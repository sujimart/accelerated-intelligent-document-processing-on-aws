"""Helpers for authoring pipeline-hook Lambdas.

A pipeline hook is a Lambda the unified workflow invokes at an extension point
(``preprocessing``, ``postOcr``, ``postClassification``, ``postExtraction``,
``postRuleValidation``, ``postSummarization``) via the host's pipeline-hooks
dispatcher. A hook may simply observe, or it may hand a MODIFIED
:class:`~idp_common.models.Document` back for the next step to consume.

This module makes the safe round-trip two calls::

    from idp_common.hooks import load_hook_document, updated_document_result

    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        document = load_hook_document(event)          # resolves compressed refs
        document.sections[0].classification = "Invoice"
        return updated_document_result(document, myField="whatever")

Why go through these helpers rather than editing the raw event dict:

- The ``document`` in the event is usually a **compressed reference** (a small
  ``{compressed: true, s3_uri, ...}`` wrapper), not the document itself.
  :func:`load_hook_document` resolves either shape.
- Returning a document you built from scratch silently drops ``metering``,
  ``errors``, ``hitl_metadata``, and ``processing_issues``. Load → mutate →
  return keeps them.
- The dispatcher only honors a document returned under the ``updatedDocument``
  key; :func:`updated_document_result` spells that contract for you.

See ``docs/feature-platform.md`` (Pipeline hooks) for the full contract,
including which mutations propagate at which hook point.

        size_threshold_kb: Compress above this size. The default keeps typical
