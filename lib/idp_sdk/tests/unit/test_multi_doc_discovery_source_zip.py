"""Unit tests for the multi-doc discovery Docker source zip.

The CodeBuild project for that nested stack builds
`-f nested/multi-doc-discovery/Dockerfile`, which COPYs
`nested/multi-doc-discovery/requirements.txt`. Both therefore MUST be in the
source zip.

This used to be broken in a way that failed silently: the buildspec heredoc'd its
own inline copies of both files, so the on-disk ones were dead weight. Dependabot
kept bumping the on-disk requirements.txt (e.g. the Pillow CVE bump in PR #530)
while the image went on building the stale inline pins — a security patch that
looked merged but never shipped. These tests lock in the single-source-of-truth
arrangement so that regression cannot come back unnoticed.
