"""
Static regression coverage for IAM Permissions Boundary propagation.

Background
----------
Some customer accounts enforce a Service Control Policy (SCP) that *requires*
every IAM role to be created with a Permissions Boundary. To support them, the
templates take an optional ``PermissionsBoundaryArn`` parameter and, when set,
attach it to every IAM role they create.

A real customer bug prompted these tests: the Feature Platform nested stack
(``feature-platform/main-stack-extensions``) neither declared the parameter nor
put a boundary on its ``FeaturePlatformLambdaRole``, AND the main template
didn't forward ``PermissionsBoundaryArn`` into that nested stack. In an
SCP-enforced account, ``iam:CreateRole`` was denied and the nested stack rolled
back on creation. Sibling feature templates had the same gap on their
SAM-auto-role functions (``FeatureApiFunction`` / ``ClaimStatusHookFunction``).

These tests fail loudly if any deployed-stack template regresses on three
invariants:

1. Every ``AWS::IAM::Role`` (and every ``AWS::Serverless::Function`` that relies
   on a SAM-auto-generated role) sets ``PermissionsBoundary``.
2. Every template that creates IAM roles declares the ``PermissionsBoundaryArn``
   parameter and the ``HasPermissionsBoundary`` condition.
3. Every nested ``AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`` forwards ``PermissionsBoundaryArn``
   to any child template that declares that parameter.

The check is deliberately static (no AWS, no deploy) so it runs in the fast
unit gate and catches the regression at author time.
