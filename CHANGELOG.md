# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Pipeline hooks can now modify the Document, not just observe it.** Post-step hooks were structurally read-only: the dispatcher extracted only the `halt` flag from a hook's response and discarded the rest, and each hook state wrote to a `$.HookResults` side branch while the next step went on reading the *pre-hook* document path — so a hook could rewrite the S3 objects a document pointed at, but could not relabel a section, add or drop one, correct an extracted attribute, adjust confidence alerts, or append metering. A hook may now return its modified document under `updatedDocument` (inline, or as a compressed reference it wrote itself for unbounded size) and the workflow will consume it: the dispatcher validates the update, threads it through any later hooks at the same point (so chained hooks compose in `order` instead of clobbering each other), and returns it under a stable `document` key that a new `Apply<Point>HookDocument` Pass state copies into the path the next step reads. Available at all six extension points, with scope set by the point — `postClassification` reaches the section Map fan-out and everything after it, while `postExtraction` runs *inside* that Map and is therefore section-scoped. New `idp_common.hooks` helpers (`load_hook_document`, `updated_document_result`) make the load → mutate → return round-trip two calls and avoid the trap of hand-building a Document (which silently drops `metering`, `errors`, `hitl_metadata`, and `processing_issues`). Guardrails: document identity (`id`/`input_key`/`input_bucket`/`output_bucket`) is immutable, a compressed reference's `s3_uri` must name an object under `compressed_documents/` in the stack's own working bucket (`Document.decompress()` discards the URI's bucket and reads the key against the consumer's working bucket, so an unconstrained URI would be a key-injection vector rather than merely a cross-bucket read), the `sections` list the Map iterates must stay well-formed, `config_version` is preserved, and inline documents are capped at 5 MB — a violation is refused and reported in `documentUpdateRejected` while the pre-hook document continues, never failing the workflow. Fields the state machine reads by JSONPath but that are not `Document` model fields (`use_bda`, `bda_project_arn`, and the wrapper's `num_pages`/`status`/`sections`) are back-filled from the inbound document, since a dropped one fails the execution outright instead of degrading. Hooks should make mutations idempotent — a retried dispatch re-invokes the hook. **Fully backward compatible**: a hook that omits `updatedDocument` passes the document through byte-identical, an inert stack behaves exactly as before, and existing hook failure paths still bypass the new state entirely. Set `allowDocumentUpdate: false` on a hook entry to pin it to observe-only. See [docs/feature-platform.md](docs/feature-platform.md#pipeline-hooks) and the [developer guide](docs/feature-platform-developer-guide.md).

### Changed

- 🔒 **The CLI's PyPI distribution name is now `idp-accelerator-cli` (the `idp-cli` command is unchanged).** The name `idp-cli` on public PyPI belongs to an unrelated legitimate project — an "Internal Developer Platform CLI" with its own releases and users — so we could never publish under it, and a user who guessed `pip install idp-cli` got somebody else's tool. Unlike `idp-common` and `idp-sdk`, this is a genuine name collision rather than a squat, so no takedown applies; the fix is to move. Renaming the *distribution* is a contained change because three other identifiers deliberately keep the old spelling: the import name (`import idp_cli`), the console command (`idp-cli`, so all documented invocations remain correct), and the `"idp-cli"` string literals used as an S3 artifact prefix, the CloudFormation `CreatedBy` tag and the Test Studio test-set name — those are persisted data, and changing them would orphan existing artifacts. `idp-accelerator-cli` is also registered on PyPI as a non-functional placeholder (`scripts/pypi-placeholders/`), so the name we now depend on cannot be taken by anyone else. **Action:** nothing is required — `make setup` picks the new name up automatically and the command you type does not change. Note that renaming a distribution does not remove the old one, so `pip list` in an existing environment will show both `idp-cli` and `idp-accelerator-cli` pointing at the same source tree; `scripts/check_first_party_deps.py` now reports the retired name and prints the `pip uninstall -y idp-cli` needed to clear it (a warning, not a failure). See [Installing First-Party Packages Safely](docs/dependency-confusion.md).
- **Removed the "Files" column from the document Version History panel.** It showed `FileCount` — the number of output S3 objects the run's manifest pinned (`sections/*/result.json`, page text/images, reports) — an internal storage-plumbing detail that reads as "how many files were in my document" (that's the adjacent **Pages** column) and offers no action. The attribute is still recorded on each run record and returned by `listDocumentVersions`/`getDocumentVersion`, and `idp-cli list-versions` still displays it. See [docs/document-versions.md](docs/document-versions.md).
- **Sample: Health Insurance Review v0.1.3 — Claims dashboard upgraded to a full Cloudscape collection table, claims can now be deleted, and the sample docs/instructions point at a working sample document.** The Processed Claims list now matches the Document List UX: multi-select with a **Delete** action (confirmation modal; new `DELETE /claims/{docId}` feature-API route, Admin/Author only — deleting removes only the dashboard record, never the document or its rule-validation outputs), text filtering, sortable + resizable columns, pagination, and table preferences (page size, wrap lines, visible columns). The empty-state instructions and [docs](docs/extensions/sample-health-insurance-review.md) now point at `samples/rule-validation/medicare_respiratory_pa_packet.pdf` — whose content actually matches the bundled NCCI policy rules and produces real Pass/Fail results (verified: 9 Pass / 5 Fail) — and the two `Prior-Auth-*.pdf` samples are removed: their content (an allergy/immunotherapy history) matched none of the NCCI surgical-coding rules, so every rule returned "Information Not Found" and the claim always landed as Insufficient documentation, which read as a bug. The sample set is now just the policy manual (for Rules Discovery) + one working claim packet.

### Fixed

- 🔒 **Dependency confusion on first-party packages: `make setup` could install a third-party `idp-sdk` from public PyPI instead of the one in `lib/`.** The first-party packages depend on their siblings by bare name (`lib/idp_cli_pkg` requires `"idp-sdk"`, `lib/idp_sdk` requires `"idp_common"`), and neither is published to PyPI — but both names **are** registered there by an unrelated third party. Because setup installed the packages one `pip install` at a time and installed `idp_cli_pkg` *before* `idp_sdk`, pip resolved the not-yet-installed sibling from the public index and silently installed the squatted package into the environment that holds AWS deployment credentials. The observed payloads were inert (they print a banner; no install hooks, no network), but the name owner can publish a new version at any time. Six fixes: (1) `make setup` / `make setup-venv` now install all first-party packages in a **single** pip invocation, so pip satisfies the sibling names from the local checkout; (2) the same consolidation in CI, which additionally (3) runs a new tripwire, `scripts/check_first_party_deps.py`, that uses [PEP 610](https://peps.python.org/pep-0610/) `direct_url.json` (written for local/VCS installs, absent for index installs) to fail the build if any installed first-party package came from an index — it works for editable and non-editable installs alike, and skips packages that simply aren't installed; (4) the two still-unclaimed names, `idp-feature-sdk` and `idp-mcp-connector`, are registered defensively on PyPI as deliberately non-functional placeholders that raise on import (`scripts/pypi-placeholders/`) so nobody else can take them; (5) every install instruction in the docs and in runtime error messages now uses a local path (`pip install -e "lib/idp_common_pkg[...]"`) — previously several, including the `idp-cli` error text, told users to `pip install idp-sdk`, i.e. to install the squat; and (6) `cli.py` no longer masks the failure. The squatted `idp_sdk` imports fine but exports nothing, so `from idp_sdk import IDPClient` raised `ImportError`, which a blanket `except ImportError` swallowed into `click = None`, surfacing much later as an unrelated `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'` — imports are now split by how they're used (module-level requirements report and exit; sdk-dependent names are stubbed and the original error is reported by `main()`), with regression tests. **Action:** if you have an existing dev environment, run `python scripts/check_first_party_deps.py`; if it fails, `pip uninstall -y idp_common idp-sdk idp-cli idp_feature_sdk idp_mcp_connector && make setup`. See the new [Dependency Confusion](docs/dependency-confusion.md) guide.
- **S3 buckets created by the CLIs and by the sample notebooks had no `EnforceSSLOnly` bucket policy, so they accepted plain-HTTP requests.** All 13 buckets in `template.yaml` (plus the SDLC pipeline's `ArtifactBucket`) carry an `AWS::S3::BucketPolicy` denying `s3:*` when `aws:SecureTransport` is false — but the buckets created *imperatively* outside CloudFormation never got the equivalent, leaving them without the in-transit-encryption control their CloudFormation-managed peers enforce. Three code paths are fixed via a new shared `idp_sdk._core.s3_security` helper: the `idp-cli publish` artifacts bucket (`idp-accelerator-artifacts-<account>-<region>`), the `idp-cli deploy` config-staging bucket (`idp-cli-config-<account>-<region>-<suffix>`), and `idp-feature-cli`'s `ensure_artifacts_bucket` (which keeps its deliberate no-`idp_sdk`-dependency isolation with a local copy). Two more gaps closed alongside: `scripts/sdlc/cfn/s3-sourcecode.yml`'s `InitialInstallBucket` gains an `InitialInstallBucketPolicy` (its `cfn_nag` W51 "bucket policy not required" suppression is dropped), and the 11 sample notebooks' `ensure_bucket_exists` helper now applies the policy to buckets it creates. The statement is applied **additively**: existing statements are preserved (so the opt-in `PackPublicArtifactsRead` public-read grant coexists with the TLS denial, and an operator's own grants survive), a stale `EnforceSSLOnly` is replaced rather than duplicated so re-running is idempotent, and ARNs use the region's real partition (`arn:aws-us-gov:` in GovCloud) mirroring `arn:${AWS::Partition}:` in the templates. The merge handles **both** forms the IAM grammar allows for `Statement` — a single statement object as well as an array ([IAM JSON policy elements: Statement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_statement.html)) — since iterating the single-object form would yield its *keys* and replace an operator's statement with the strings `"Sid"`, `"Effect"`, …; the pre-existing `PackPublicArtifactsRead` merge path is corrected for the same latent flaw. Unlike Block Public Access — which the publisher deliberately never touches on a bucket it didn't create, so a manual remediation can't be reverted — this only ever *tightens* access and so is also applied to pre-existing buckets, best-effort there (a `PutBucketPolicy` denial warns and continues rather than failing the publish, since the operator may own that bucket's policy; on a bucket we just created it is fatal). The `idp-cli deploy` config-staging bucket is hardened on **reuse** as well as creation, since `get_or_create_config_bucket` returns early on a prefix match and is the only code that touches those buckets — otherwise the ones left unhardened by an older `idp-cli` would stay that way. **Note:** running the sample notebooks now requires `s3:PutBucketPolicy` on the buckets they create. See [lib/idp_sdk/README.md](lib/idp_sdk/README.md#buckets-the-cli-creates) and [lib/idp_feature_sdk/README.md](lib/idp_feature_sdk/README.md#artifacts-bucket-security).
- **Changing a UI-affecting CloudFormation parameter on an existing stack had no effect, because the Web UI was never rebuilt.** Reported as: adding `AllowedSignUpEmailDomain` to a running stack correctly flipped the backend — `UserPool.AdminCreateUserConfig.AllowAdminCreateUserOnly` went to `false` and the `PreSignUp`/`PreAuthentication` domain-verify Lambda was created, so self-service signup really was permitted — yet the Cognito login screen still hid the **Sign Up** tab, which a *new* stack with the same parameter offers. The cause is a build-time/runtime split: the UI reads these settings as `import.meta.env.VITE_*`, which Vite substitutes **textually at `npm run build`** and freezes into the JS bundle in `WebUIBucket`. On a parameter change CloudFormation dutifully updated `UICodeBuildProject`'s `VITE_SHOULD_HIDE_SIGN_UP` env var — but mutating a CodeBuild *project definition* does not run a build. The only thing that runs one is the `CodeBuildRun` custom resource, and its properties (`BuildProjectName`, `SettingsParameter`, `CodeLocation`) are all derived from names and the source-zip filename, none of which depend on any parameter. With no property diff, CloudFormation skipped the resource entirely — no Update event, no `start_build` — and the stale bundle stayed deployed. (A fresh stack *create* always runs the build once, which is exactly why this gate was invisible to create-only end-to-end testing; and a version upgrade changes `CodeLocation`, which is why it never showed up there either.) `CodeBuildRun` now carries a `UIBuildInputs` property joining every parameter that Vite bakes in — `AllowedSignUpEmailDomain`, `ExternalIdPType`, `ExternalIdPName`, `ExternalIdPAutoLogin`, `EnableQuickStartWidget`, `WebUIHosting`, `CustomDomainUrl` — so a parameter-only update produces a diff and rebuilds the UI. **The same latent bug affected all seven**, not just signup: the external-IdP sign-in button, IdP auto-login, the Quick Start widget, and the asset base path / OAuth redirect origin all silently failed to take effect on an update-only change. Deliberately *not* listed are values the UI resolves at runtime from the SSM settings parameter (`ConsoleTitle`, `DefaultFeatureId`, and the `AllowedSignUpEmailDomains` the User Management screen reads) — those already apply on the next page load, and forcing a ~30-minute UI rebuild for them would be a regression. A new static test derives the baked-parameter set from the template itself (following `!If` through condition definitions, since `VITE_SHOULD_HIDE_SIGN_UP` never names its parameter directly) and asserts every member is a rebuild trigger, so a newly-added baked parameter fails CI rather than quietly regressing. See [docs/web-ui.md](docs/web-ui.md#parameters-baked-into-the-ui-at-build-time) for the parameter list and the manual-rebuild recovery command.
- **Test Set Generator — generating into an existing test set no longer overwrites its documents or clobbers its metadata.** Several fixes to the [Test Set Generator extension](docs/extensions/idp-data-generator.md) (feature id `idp-data-generator`, bumped to `0.1.2`): (1) each generation run now prefixes its uploaded filenames with a per-run token, so appending to an existing test set **adds** documents instead of overwriting the prior run's identically-named `doc_0001.pdf`…; (2) the generate modal separates the destination (**create a new test set** vs **add to an existing one**) from the config version, and a collision guard — client-side and re-checked in the feature API — blocks "create new" against a name that already exists (including a set still `GENERATING`); (3) the host test-set record is written via a non-clobbering upsert that preserves an existing set's name/description/`createdAt` and populates `InitialEventTime` so the record stays visible to the Test Studio list (the `AWSDateTime` timestamp is now `Z`-suffixed UTC, which the API requires); (4) a failed **append** run restores the set to `COMPLETED` (with its true document count) rather than marking the whole set `FAILED`; and (5) both generate routes now require the caller to be in the `Admin` or `Author` Cognito group. See [docs/extensions/idp-data-generator.md](docs/extensions/idp-data-generator.md).
- **Dependabot security bumps to the multi-doc discovery container never reached the built image.** The nested stack's CodeBuild buildspec heredoc'd its *own* inline copies of `requirements.txt` and the `Dockerfile` into the build directory, so the checked-in `nested/multi-doc-discovery/{requirements.txt,Dockerfile}` were dead files that nothing consumed. The two silently forked: Dependabot bumped the on-disk `requirements.txt` to `Pillow==12.3.0` (PR #530) while the image went on installing the inline `Pillow==12.1.1` — a merged CVE patch that never shipped. Compounding it, **two separate rebuild gates also ignored those files**: neither was listed in the component's smart-rebuild dependencies (so a bump didn't invalidate the template checksum), and — the load-bearing one — the `BuildHash` property that is the *sole* trigger for re-running the container build hashed only `src/lambda/multi_doc_discovery`. A bump therefore left `BuildHash` byte-identical, so on an in-place stack update CloudFormation saw no change to the `DockerBuildRun` custom resource, never re-invoked it, and the ECR image kept the vulnerable dependency. (A fresh stack create always builds, which is why this gate was invisible to end-to-end create testing.) The buildspec now builds `-f nested/multi-doc-discovery/Dockerfile` from the source zip (which `publish.py` now includes, failing the publish loudly if either input is missing), both files feed `BuildHash` **and** the component dependencies, and tests assert both that the buildspec contains no inline dependency pins and that `BuildHash` actually moves when either build input changes — so the fork cannot silently return. See [nested/multi-doc-discovery/template.yaml](nested/multi-doc-discovery/template.yaml).
- **A transient PyPI connection drop during the container build no longer fails the whole stack deploy.** A mid-stream `BrokenPipeError` while pulling a large wheel (numpy is ~18 MB) surfaces as a hard `pip ... exit 2`, which cascaded unrecoverably: `docker build` failed → `docker push` failed → CodeBuild FAILED → the `DockerBuildRun` custom resource reported FAILED → the nested stack rolled back → the entire deploy failed, ~26 minutes in, on a fault unrelated to the change under test. The `pip install` steps now use `--retries 10 --timeout 60` inside a bounded 3-attempt retry loop (pip's own retries do not cover stream-level faults), `docker push` retries up to 3 times, and the `DockerBuildRun` custom resource retries a FAILED/FAULT build once — within its Lambda budget, always reserving time to answer CloudFormation, and never retrying a deliberately STOPPED or TIMED_OUT build. Its failure message now names the build and project so a reader knows which log stream holds the real cause.
- **A rollback could wedge the stack in `ROLLBACK_FAILED`, requiring manual intervention.** S3 permits only one conditional bucket-config operation against a bucket at a time, but CloudFormation deleted `TestSetBucketPolicy`, `TestSetBucketAutoDelete` and `TestSetBucketNotificationConfiguration` in the same instant, so `PutBucketNotificationConfiguration` returned `OperationAborted` ("A conflicting conditional operation is currently in progress"). The inline handler had no retry and failed hard, turning a recoverable rollback into `ROLLBACK_FAILED` — even though the identical call succeeded three minutes later. Three fixes: the handler retries transient S3 codes on a bounded backoff ladder (sized to fit inside its Lambda timeout, which is raised accordingly), a **Delete** now always reports success so notification cleanup can never block a teardown (the bucket is `Retain` anyway, mirroring `TestSetBucketAutoDeleteFunction`), and `DependsOn: TestSetBucketPolicy` serializes the two conditional writes to remove the race at its source. The CI harness also treats this conflict as a known transient race, so a residual occurrence is retried rather than failing the pipeline.
- **CI deployment summaries now name the real root cause instead of dead-ending at "CodeBuild failed".** When a nested stack failed because its container build failed, the only evidence in CloudFormation was `CodeBuild failed with status: FAILED` — the actual error (a pip network fault, a Docker layer error, an ECR auth failure) lived solely in that build's own log stream, which no summary ever read, so every such failure produced an unactionable report. The harness now resolves the failing CodeBuild project from the nested stack that reported it, finds its most recent build in a **terminal failure** state (deliberately not merely "not succeeded" — with the new one-shot build retry above, the newest build is often still `IN_PROGRESS`, and an in-progress build carries no failure phase, so reporting it would attach empty evidence and skip the build that actually failed), and attaches that build's failing phase, phase error, log tail, and console URL to the summary (snapshotted before teardown, alongside the existing CloudFormation events). Two related corrections: the recovery command is now derived in Python from the stack's real status — a CREATE rollback lands in `ROLLBACK_FAILED`, where the previously-suggested `continue-update-rollback` is invalid and only errors out (it applies solely to `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED`) — and the primary failure that *caused* a rollback is now reported separately from any secondary failure that merely *blocked* it, rather than listing both as peers. See [scripts/sdlc/codebuild_deployment.py](scripts/sdlc/codebuild_deployment.py).
- **Historical document versions no longer report "Low Confidence Fields: 0" for every section.** Viewing a past version showed a zero low-confidence count (and an empty section Status) even when that run had low-confidence fields, because the per-section quality data was dropped at all three layers: `create_document_run` never snapshotted `ConfidenceThresholdAlerts`/`ProcessingIssues` into the run record (unlike `update_document`, which writes both to the live document item), the versions resolver's `_shape_version` omitted them, and the `GetDocumentVersion` query didn't select them. All three now carry the fields, so a historical view renders the same counts and section status the live document does. **Note:** the snapshot is written at run-completion time, so this applies to runs recorded *after* upgrading — versions already in the table have no stored alerts and will continue to show 0. Runs missing the attributes return `[]` (not null), matching the live-document shape.
- **Developer Tests CI job no longer fails with `npm: not found` when NodeSource is unreachable.** The workflow installed Node 22 by piping NodeSource's installer into bash (`curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | bash -`). That pipeline reports bash's exit status, not curl's, so when NodeSource returned HTTP 403 the failure was swallowed: the apt repo was never registered, the following `apt-get install -y nodejs` quietly installed Debian bookworm's own **nodejs 18** — which ships no `npm` — and the job died several steps later with a bare `npm: not found`, giving no hint that a download had failed. Node is now installed with the first-party `actions/setup-node` action (SHA-pinned, matching what `deploy-docs.yml` already does), which fails loudly and immediately on a download problem and doesn't depend on NodeSource being reachable. See [.github/workflows/developer-tests.yml](.github/workflows/developer-tests.yml).
- **Rule Validation report/tab missing from the document detail page (regression from the AppSync removal).** The document detail UI renders the "View Rule Validation Summary" button and the Rule Validation tab only when the `getDocument` response carries the flat `RuleValidationResultUri` scalar, but the write path stored only the nested `RuleValidationResult` object — the flat scalar was never persisted. The old `appsync/service.py` set `RuleValidationResultUri = rule_validation_result.output_uri` "for backward compatibility"; that line was dropped when document writes moved to `dynamodb/service.py`. Restore it in both the `update_document` expression and the `create_document_run` snapshot item, so a completed rule-validation run surfaces its report in the UI. See [lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/dynamodb/service.py](lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/dynamodb/service.py).
- **Sample: Health Insurance Review — prior-auth documents produced no rule-validation output and never appeared in the Claims dashboard (v0.1.2).** Two compounding defects. (1) The bundled config preset's policy classes matched the document *filename* with `x-aws-idp-document-name-regex: ...(prior_auth|pa_packet)...` — an underscore — but the sample documents it ships with (`samples/rule-validation/Prior-Auth-*.pdf`) use a hyphen, so classification returned `NO_POLICY_MATCH`, rule validation was skipped, and zero rules were evaluated. The regex now accepts any of `-`, `_`, or space (`prior[_ -]?auth`, `pa[_ -]?packet`) across all seven policy classes. (2) The unified workflow's rule-validation skip paths (`SetSkippedRuleValidationResult` for no-policy-match, `SetEmptyRuleValidationResult` for rule-validation-disabled) jumped straight to summarization, **bypassing the `PostRuleValidationHook` dispatch** — so a document that skipped rule validation never fired the feature's `postRuleValidation` hook and thus never recorded a claim (even to flag it as needing documentation). Both skip states now route through `PostRuleValidationHook`; the dispatcher is a no-op when no hook is registered, and the feature's hook records a `NO_POLICY_MATCH` run as `INSUFFICIENT_DOCUMENTATION`. See [patterns/unified/statemachine/workflow.asl.json](patterns/unified/statemachine/workflow.asl.json) and [feature-platform/sample-health-insurance-review/config-preset/claims-config.yaml](feature-platform/sample-health-insurance-review/config-preset/claims-config.yaml).
- **Sample: Health Insurance Review — Rules Discovery tab failed with "No GraphQL endpoint configured in `Amplify.configure()`" (v0.1.1).** The feature's Rules Discovery flow still called `aws-amplify/api`'s `generateClient().graphql()`, which stopped working when the host replaced AppSync with the REST dispatcher (Amplify now carries no GraphQL endpoint — it is configured for Cognito auth only). The feature now uses the host's REST-backed, GraphQL-shaped client exposed at `window.IdpFeatureHost.generateClient` (the same migration the PII Anonymization feature already made), so uploadDiscoveryDocument / listDiscoveryJobs / getConfigVersion go through the same transport as the host UI. Also, all feature ui-deployers (template + 4 bundled features) previously copied `ui-bundle.js` into the Web UI bucket with `Cache-Control: max-age=31536000,immutable`, which pinned a stale bundle in browsers for up to a year when the same feature version was republished (hotfixes); they now use `max-age=300`, matching the CloudFront distribution's own TTL, so an update propagates within minutes. (#568)

## [0.6.2]

### Added

- **Generic `preprocessing` pipeline-hook point.** A new standalone extension point that runs *first* in the document-processing workflow — before the BDA/pipeline routing — so it fires in both processing modes and even when OCR is disabled, operating on the source document itself. Unlike the post-step `postHook` lists, it is a single flat hook in its own top-level `preprocessing` config section (`arn` + generic key/value `args`, no feature-specific fields), editable in the View/Edit Configuration UI and reusable for any preprocessing job. A hook may return `halt: true` to end the execution (e.g. after spawning a replacement document), and `onError: fail` is terminal — a failed hook stops the execution rather than falling through to processing the un-preprocessed original. While the hook runs, the document's visible status shows **`PREPROCESSING`** (a new `Status` member, abortable like other in-flight statuses) instead of the generic `RUNNING`. Fully backward-compatible: a no-op when no hook is registered. New host export `<MainStackName>-InputBucketName`. See [Feature Platform → Pipeline hooks](docs/feature-platform.md#pipeline-hooks).

- **PII Anonymization extension.** A bundled [Extension Feature](docs/extensions/pii-anonymizer.md) — the reference consumer of the new `preprocessing` hook point — that detects and redacts PII from source documents **before** the classification/extraction models see them, so the document-processing pipeline (classification, extraction, assessment, summarization — including its prompts, logs, and stored results) operates only on de-identified content. (The redaction step itself uses a Bedrock model to *detect* the PII, so PII does transit that single detection call.) The hook writes a de-identified copy of each document back to the Input bucket beside the original with a `(REDACTED)` marker in its name (with a re-entrancy guard against redaction loops), tagged to re-process under a **companion** config version; two modes — *redact copy and stop* (the original is deleted so only the redacted copy remains) and *redact copy and continue* (original + redacted as separate documents, scoped by `allowedConfigVersions` RBAC). PDFs are redacted PDF-in/PDF-out (image path, flattened, no leaked text layer). A **Config Pairing** wizard clones an admin's existing config version into the matched pair via host config APIs; a **Redaction Report** tab shows a metadata-only audit (no PII stored) and — opt-in, stored in a feature-owned encrypted DynamoDB table and RBAC-gated to users with access to the original's config version — the original→synthetic PII mapping. Flagged **experimental**. Reuses the document detection/redaction library from AWS Labs [pii-anonymizer](https://github.com/awslabs/pii-anonymizer) (Apache-2.0), vendored under the feature with a re-sync skill. See [docs/extensions/pii-anonymizer.md](docs/extensions/pii-anonymizer.md).

- **Test Set Generator extension — generate labeled synthetic test sets from Test Studio.** A new installable [Extension Feature](docs/extensions/idp-data-generator.md) (feature id `idp-data-generator`, AgentCore Runtime) adds a **Generate Synthetic Data** button to **Test Studio → Test Sets**: describe a document type in plain language (or pick an existing configuration version), optionally add a scenario theme (with a Bedrock-backed **Suggest** helper) and a quality setting, review the live cost/time estimate, and a background job lands the labeled synthetic documents as a new test set. Generated documents can be previewed in-place, and a **Generate test set** button on **View/Edit Configuration → Document Schema** deep-links into the pre-filled modal. Generation is powered by the open-source [SEED](https://github.com/awslabs/synthetically_engineered_evaluation_data) package (`seed-data`), which the Quick Start / `idp-cli bootstrap` generator also uses (optional `idp_common[synthesis-generator]` extra — schema authoring, catalog matching, and config/test-set creation all work without it). A runtime watchdog fails a wedged job instead of leaving it stuck IN_PROGRESS. See [docs/extensions/idp-data-generator.md](docs/extensions/idp-data-generator.md).

- **Claude Opus 5 model support.** Anthropic's Claude Opus 5 (`anthropic.claude-opus-5`, launched on Bedrock 2026-07-23) is now selectable everywhere Opus 4.8 is: all service model dropdowns (classification, extraction incl. per-class overrides, assessment, summarization, confidence, evaluation, chat), the `us.`/`eu.`/`global.` geo cross-region inference profiles, and the `:1m` long-context variants. Pricing matches Opus 4.8 ($5/$25 per MTok standard; $10/$37.50 above 200K input on `:1m`); prompt caching and reasoning effort (`low`–`max`) are supported, and sampling parameters (temperature/top_p/top_k) are stripped as for Opus 4.7/4.8. Notes: Opus 5 has a 1M-token context window natively, but the base ID keeps the 200K auto-sizing budget (pick the `:1m` variant to opt into the full window and its long-context pricing); thinking is on by default (runs within `max_tokens`); no `jp.` geo profile (unlike Opus 4.8) and not yet available in GovCloud. US/EU region filtering maps `us.` ↔ `eu.` variants directly.

- **Test Set document browser with ground-truth visual editor.** Click a COMPLETED test set's name in Test Studio (or select it and click **Browse Documents**) to open `/test-studio/sets/<id>`: a paginated table of the set's documents with lazy client-rendered first-page **thumbnails** (pdfjs ranged fetch — large PDFs only download the chunks needed for page 1). Each document name links to a per-document detail page (`/test-studio/sets/<id>/doc/<file>`, mirroring the Document List → Document Details structure) with two views: an inline **View Source Document** viewer, and an **Edit Ground Truth** visual editor showing the document's page images (rendered in-browser from the source PDF/image) beside an editable form over the baseline's `inference_result`, with a raw JSON tab, a multi-section selector for packet-splitting sets (page images scoped to each section's `split_document.page_indices`), and bounding-box field highlighting when the baseline carries `explainability_info` geometry. Saves write back to the test set's `baseline/.../result.json` with an `_editHistory` provenance entry (Admin/Author; other roles read-only). Backed by a new Admin/Author `getTestSetDocuments` API (paginated, optional exact-match `objectKey` filter); the TestSetBucket CORS now permits GET/HEAD + ranged reads for the browser's presigned fetches, and the file-contents/upload resolvers gained TestSetBucket read/write grants. See [Test Studio](docs/test-studio.md#browsing-test-set-documents-and-ground-truth) and [Creating Custom Test Sets](docs/creating-custom-test-sets.md).

- **Central input-shape validation on the UI API.** The `POST /op/{field}` dispatcher now validates every request's `arguments` against a build-time spec generated from `schema.graphql` — rejecting unknown arguments, missing required (non-null) arguments, wrong scalar types, and out-of-set enum values with HTTP 400, before the request reaches a resolver. This re-establishes the boundary input-shape gate that AppSync provided and the REST migration lost, closing a type-confusion / unexpected-argument defense-in-depth gap. It is intentionally **stricter than AppSync on input coercion** (AppSync coerced a scalar to a one-element list, an int to an `ID` string, and accepted bare-scalar `AWSJSON`; this validator rejects those) — safe for the current Web UI, which sends list args as arrays, IDs as strings, and `AWSJSON` as `JSON.stringify` objects (verified across all UI operations). The validator is stdlib-only (no runtime GraphQL dependency), conservative (type-only checks, shallow input-object validation), and fails open on its own internal errors so a validator bug can never take down the API. A drift guard keeps the spec in sync with the schema in CI. Threat model updated (AUTH.T12); see [AppSync→REST migration §4](docs/migration-appsync-to-rest.md).

- **Dynamic security testing (DAST) in the integration pipeline.** An authenticated [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) scan of the deployed UI REST API now runs on every integration build as the `zapdast` deployment-variant probe — on its own throwaway stack, fully concurrent with the existing suite (≈zero added wall-clock). It adds the class of coverage neither the SRT static scan nor the RBAC authorization harness provides: injection (XSS/SQLi), missing security headers (CSP/HSTS/X-Frame-Options), cookie/TLS flags, and information disclosure. Because the API is a single Cognito-gated `POST /op/{field}` route with no OpenAPI spec, the scan is seeded from `scripts/api_rbac_expectations.yaml` (the shared op source-of-truth) and authenticated with a Cognito token via the shared `scripts/rbac_common.py`. WARN-only for now (full HTML/JSON report uploaded to S3 and pulled into GitLab artifacts; rule actions tunable in `scripts/sdlc/zap-rules.conf`), with a documented path to promote high-confidence rules to hard-fail. Passive baseline runs every build; the active scan is opt-in via `IDP_ZAP_ACTIVE=true`. Requires `PrivilegedMode` on the `app-sdlc` CodeBuild project for Docker. See [CI test coverage](scripts/sdlc/docs/CI_TEST_COVERAGE.md#zap-dast-probe-dynamic-security-testing).

- **Auditable security test results.** A new top-level `security/` directory collects the threat model (moved from `threat-modeling/`) and, under `security/test-results/<version>/`, curated Markdown snapshots of the four security tests — SRT (SAST/deps), ZAP DAST, and RBAC static + dynamic — each with a `MANIFEST.md` tying results to a version, git SHA, and date. `security/README.md` documents each test's coverage, goals, and how to run it (with threat-model cross-references). A single command — `make security-results STACK_NAME=<stack>` (or just `make security-results` for the offline SRT + RBAC-static tests) — runs the tests and regenerates the snapshot; `scripts/security/curate_results.py` generates the Markdown and is **public-safe by construction**: it re-emits only publish-safe fields, redacts environment identifiers (account IDs, Cognito pool IDs, API hostnames, request IDs, local paths, AWS keys/secrets), and reconciles SRT findings to the CI view. Each result file leads with a summary and enumerates the tests that executed (ZAP per-rule outcomes, the RBAC op×role matrix, the static S1–S5 checks, SRT analyzers). See the [curate-security-results skill](.claude/skills/curate-security-results.md) and [CI test coverage](scripts/sdlc/docs/CI_TEST_COVERAGE.md#security-tests-coverage--auditable-results).

### Changed

- **Catalog features can now opt out of the Extensions nav until installed (`showInNav`), and the bundled samples do.** Previously every catalog feature got a side-nav entry — so the two bundled samples (*Sample: Document Status (feature add-on)* and *Sample: Health Insurance Review*) appeared with Install badges even on stacks where they were never deployed. A new optional `showInNav` flag (default `true`) in `feature.yaml` (OSS) / `extensions-marketplace.yaml` (marketplace) controls whether a not-yet-installed catalog feature gets its own nav entry; the two samples set it to `false`. A new **Browse catalog** nav link — pinned at the top of the Extensions section, italicized and separated from the extension links by a divider so it reads as the catalog entry point rather than another extension — opens a catalog browser page (`/features`) listing every extension — installed and available, including nav-hidden ones — with status badges and links to each feature's install/update page. Installed features always appear in the nav regardless of the flag. See [docs/feature-platform.md](docs/feature-platform.md).

- **Renamed the `EnableHeadless` CloudFormation parameter to `EnableJobsApi`.** The old name conflated this parameter with "headless mode" — but it is an *additive* switch that stands up the Jobs REST API (Private API Gateway + `/jobs` endpoints + supporting Lambdas + a machine-to-machine Cognito OAuth client) **in addition to** the Web UI; it does not remove the UI. (That is the separate `idp-cli deploy --headless` template transform, which is unchanged.) The parameter, its metadata (ParameterGroups/ParameterLabels), the `JobsApiRequiresVPC` rule, and all docs now say "Jobs API". **Upgrade note (breaking parameter rename):** existing stacks deployed with `EnableHeadless` must supply `EnableJobsApi` (with the same `true`/`false` value) on their next stack update — the old parameter name is no longer recognized. See [docs/govcloud-deployment.md](docs/govcloud-deployment.md). (#525)

### Fixed

- **MCP `get_results` can now fetch a single document's results, and one broken tool no longer disables the whole MCP tool suite.** Two fixes for external MCP consumers (e.g. downstream gateways fed by post-processing hook events, which carry a document reference but no batch id): (1) `get_results` accepts a new `document_id` argument — the document's S3 object key or its `s3://` output-prefix URI — as an alternative to `batch_id`, backed by a new `idp_sdk` `client.batch.get_document_results()`; the gateway tool schema no longer hard-requires `batch_id`, and the schema is now re-synced onto existing gateway targets during stack updates (previously it was only sent at target creation, so schema changes never reached deployed gateways). (2) The MCP handler imported the analytics agent stack (`strands`) at module load, so a missing/incomplete agents Lambda layer failed the import of the whole handler — every tool died with `Runtime.ImportModuleError`. Tool modules are now imported lazily per call: batch tools work regardless, and `search` returns a structured error naming the missing dependency. See [docs/mcp-server.md](docs/mcp-server.md).

- **Multi-Doc Discovery container-image Lambdas no longer fail to pull their image on a stack update.** The `MultiDocDiscoveryEmbed`/`Cluster`/`Save`/`Analyze` functions are container-image Lambdas backed by a stack-created ECR repository that had **no repository policy** and whose execution roles carried **no `ecr:` pull actions** — the functions relied on Lambda auto-attaching a pull policy at function *create* time. That auto-attach is best-effort and is **not reapplied on update**, so when a later change forces the functions to update (e.g. the AppSync→DynamoDB env-var/IAM edit), the image re-pull fails with `The function does not have permission to access the specified image` and the functions never stabilize — failing the stack update. The ECR repository now declares an explicit `RepositoryPolicyText` granting the Lambda service (`lambda.amazonaws.com`, scoped to functions in this account/region) `ecr:BatchGetImage` and `ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer`, so the pull permission is durable across updates. (The CMK that encrypts the repo needs no change — Amazon ECR decrypts image layers server-side via a grant it creates on the key at repo-create time; the pulling principal does not call KMS.) See [nested/multi-doc-discovery/template.yaml](nested/multi-doc-discovery/template.yaml).

- **Pinned `ruff` in CI to keep the format gate reproducible.** Both CI lint jobs installed `ruff` unpinned (`uv pip install ruff`), so a newer release (0.16.0, which began reformatting Python code blocks embedded in Markdown) started failing `ruff format --check` on ~49 unchanged `.md` files repo-wide — unrelated to any PR's diff. `ruff` is now pinned to `0.15.13` (the version the repo is formatted against) in `.github/workflows/developer-tests.yml` and `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

- **S3 console folder creation no longer triggers spurious processing or pollutes Test Studio pattern matching.** Creating a "folder" in the input bucket via the S3 console writes a zero-byte pseudo-object whose key ends in `/` (e.g. `testfolder/`). The Queue Sender Lambda treated it as a document — creating a tracking entry and starting a Step Functions execution for empty content — and Test Studio's "Add Test Set from File Pattern" (`find_matching_files`) could pull such placeholders into a test set. Both paths now skip `/`-terminated keys (the trailing-slash guard already used elsewhere in the codebase). (#552)

- **Documents with `#` in their name no longer break View Data / View Page Text and results metadata.** `urllib.parse.urlparse` treats `#` in an S3 URI as a URL-fragment delimiter, so keys like `Report_#2.pdf/pages/1/result.json` were silently truncated at the `#`, causing `NoSuchKey` errors ("No response from getFileContents" in the UI) and wrongly-named `.metadata.json` files. The `getFileContents`/`getFilePresignedUrl` resolver and the two processresults functions now parse S3 URIs with a plain string split (matching `idp_common.utils.parse_s3_uri`), preserving `#` in keys.

- **Multi-doc discovery zip upload now works end-to-end.** The flow was broken two ways: `uploadMultiDocDiscoveryZip` returned a presigned **POST** form while the UI uploads with a raw HTTP **PUT** (so the zip never landed in S3), and the upload and start mutations each minted their own random job-id S3 path (so even a successful upload was looked up at a different key and the pipeline's Prepare step failed with a 404). The upload mutation now returns a plain presigned PUT URL, and both mutations derive the same deterministic key (`multi-doc-discovery/uploads/<fileName>`); callers that pass the returned `objectKey` back as `s3Prefix` are still honored verbatim.

- **Claude Sonnet 5 now appears in the UI model picker.** Sonnet 5 (`claude-sonnet-5` and the `:1m` extended-context variant) was present in pricing, model limits, and the Bedrock client routing — and is the system default extraction model — but was missing from the CloudFormation model enums in `patterns/unified/template.yaml` that feed the config schema, so it never showed in the config UI's model dropdown. Both variants are now registered across all three inference-profile prefixes (`us.`/`eu.`/`global.`). (#544)

- **Addressed package vulnerabilities flagged by recent dependency scans.** Upgraded affected direct and transitive dependencies across the web UI (`src/ui`), the docs site, and the multi-doc-discovery and OCR-benchmark Lambdas to their patched versions.

- **Added security response headers to the UI API (execute-api layer).** A DAST scan flagged the API Gateway `execute-api` endpoint for missing `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and `X-Frame-Options`, and a permissive CORS `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. The CloudFront distribution that serves the SPA already sets these, but a client hitting the API directly did not receive them. The dispatcher's `_http_response` (the `/op` POST responses) and the API Gateway OPTIONS-preflight + 4xx/5xx gateway responses now emit `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`, and `X-Frame-Options: DENY` (plus `Referrer-Policy` on the Lambda responses). The CORS wildcard stays the default (it is safe — the UI sends a Bearer JWT, never credentials/cookies, and a non-wildcard origin would create a CloudFront→API CloudFormation dependency cycle). A `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN` env var is available as a **code-level hook** (read by the dispatcher; not wired to a stack parameter) for forks that pin the Lambda's environment to lock the `/op` origin down. In `ServeWebUI` mode (API Gateway hosts the SPA, no CloudFront), the SPA document/asset responses also carry the security-header trio.

- **Closed the Agent Chat authorization gap (Reviewer exclusion now server-side, not UI-only).** `sendAgentChatMessage` and `listAvailableAgents` restricted Agent Chat to Admin/Author/Viewer only through UI navigation — a Reviewer calling the API directly was accepted. Both resolvers now enforce the group server-side via a `_caller_in_groups` check (matching `calculateCapacity`), and `schema.graphql` declares the real `@aws_cognito_user_pools(cognito_groups:["Admin","Author","Viewer"])` restriction. The original constraint (AppSync could not combine a `cognito_groups` restriction with `@aws_iam` on one field) no longer applies now that AppSync has been removed; the IAM backend publish path carries no Cognito identity and is unaffected. Previously tracked as accepted-risk GAP-03 in the RBAC test register; now hard-gated (a regression fails `make api-test`). See the [api-rbac-test skill](.claude/skills/api-rbac-test.md) and [docs/rbac.md](docs/rbac.md).

- **Closed three API authorization gaps (server-side RBAC now matches the schema).** Three operations previously relied on a schema directive that the REST dispatcher's Cognito authorizer does not enforce, with no matching server-side check: (1) **`listUsers`** was readable by any authenticated user, exposing every user's email and role to Viewers/Reviewers — now Admin-only (server-side check + `@aws_cognito_user_pools(cognito_groups:["Admin"])`); (2) **`calculateCapacity`** had no server-side group check despite a schema directive, so a Reviewer calling it directly succeeded — now enforces Admin/Author/Viewer server-side; (3) the feature-platform ops **`subscribeFeature`/`unsubscribeFeature`/`getFeatureLaunchUrl`** declared the silently-ignored `@aws_auth` directive (or none) — now declare `@aws_cognito_user_pools(cognito_groups:["Admin"])` matching the Admin enforcement their resolvers already performed (defense-in-depth; these three were not exploitable). All were previously tracked as accepted-risk GAP-04/05/06 in the RBAC test register; they are now hard-gated (a regression fails `make api-test`). Threat model updated (AUTH.T08). See the [api-rbac-test skill](.claude/skills/api-rbac-test.md).

- **GovCloud deployments now succeed end-to-end out of the box.** A batch of GovCloud (`us-gov-west-1`) fixes, all verified live against a real deployment: (1) the `--govcloud` template transform now defaults `KnowledgeBaseVectorStore` to `OPENSEARCH_SERVERLESS` (S3 Vectors is unsupported for Bedrock Knowledge Bases in GovCloud), `KnowledgeBaseModelId` to a GovCloud-verified model (`amazon.nova-pro-v1:0` — the commercial `us.`/`eu.`/`global.` cross-region inference-profile prefixes are all invalid there), and `ConfigurationPreset` to `lending-package-sample-govcloud` (the commercial preset pins Bedrock models that don't exist/aren't offered in GovCloud); (2) the `lending-package-sample-govcloud` preset now pins GovCloud-invokable models across every stage (summarization, chat, evaluation via `llm_method.model`, discovery/auto-split/rules, and the agents) instead of retired Claude 3.x IDs, and adds a self-healing `escalation_model`; (3) the `CognitoAuthorizedRole` trust policy now lists the GovCloud Cognito Identity federated principals (login failed with `InvalidIdentityPoolConfigurationException` without them — the commercial principal passes CFN validation silently but never lets the identity pool assume the role); (4) S3 Vectors ARNs are now built from the deploy region's partition instead of a hardcoded `arn:aws:`; (5) the AgentCore gateway falls back to a no-semantic-search gateway (semantic search is unsupported in GovCloud) instead of failing the stack; (6) the main-template cfn-lint pre-check is skipped for `--govcloud` publishes (the un-transformed template contains UI/CloudFront/Cognito resources that don't exist in GovCloud regions), matching the existing `--headless` behavior; and (7) the HTTP-API field→resolver SSM parameter is de-duplicated to one entry per resolver Lambda (with duplicate fields routed via dispatcher aliases) so it fits the 8 KB Advanced-tier limit once the longer `arn:aws-us-gov:` ARNs are resolved — this last fix also benefits commercial deployments. GovCloud-verified `KnowledgeBaseModelId` entries and matching pricing entries were added. See [docs/govcloud-deployment.md](docs/govcloud-deployment.md).

## [0.6.1]

### Added

- **OpenAI GPT-5.6 (Sol / Terra / Luna) models on Amazon Bedrock.** Adds `openai.gpt-5.6-sol` (flagship reasoning), `openai.gpt-5.6-terra` (GPT-5.5-class quality at roughly half the cost), and `openai.gpt-5.6-luna` (fastest / lowest cost), served on the `bedrock-mantle` OpenAI Responses API alongside the existing GPT-5.4/5.5. Selectable for OCR, classification, extraction, assessment, summarization, evaluation, and Chat-with-Document. Unlike 5.4/5.5 (which cache automatically), GPT-5.6 supports **explicit prompt caching** via `<<CACHEPOINT>>` markers (90% cache-read discount; a 30-minute cache-write is metered). **Not supported:** agentic extraction, Discovery, and Policy Discovery (rejected by `config-validate` and at runtime). **Regions:** US only — Sol in `us-east-1`/`us-east-2`, Terra/Luna add `us-west-2`; no EU/global and **no GovCloud** (GovCloud remains GPT-5.4 only). See [OpenAI GPT-5.x Models](docs/openai-models.md). (#519)

- **Blogs, Customer Stories & Research references page.** A new [references doc](docs/references.md) collects and summarizes external publications about the accelerator: AWS ML blog feature deep-dives (including automated schema generation / multi-document discovery), customer reference stories (Myriad Genetics, Associa, Ricoh, Built Technologies) with real-world accuracy/cost/throughput results, and the peer-reviewed research papers (the IDP Accelerator arxiv paper and DocSplit, both ACL 2026). Linked from the docs index and the Starlight sidebar. (#507)

- **Error Analyzer agent can name the exact model behind a Bedrock model error.** A new `fetch_pipeline_configuration` tool returns the Bedrock model ID configured for each pipeline stage of a document's config version. Because a retired/unavailable-model error (`ResourceNotFoundException` — "This model version has reached the end of its life") does not name the model, the agent previously could only tell the user to "go confirm the configured model". It now reads the failing stage's model and names it definitively (GitHub #504 follow-up).

- **Simple extraction now drops off-schema fields before assessment.** Traditional (non-agentic) extraction previously kept whatever the model returned (raw `json.loads`), so a hallucinated or cross-class attribute (e.g. a `resume` section coming back with a `publications` list) flowed into `inference_result` and later broke confidence assessment. A new schema-compliance filter drops top-level fields not defined in the class schema right after parsing — mirroring what Advanced (agentic) extraction already does via its Pydantic model — at zero extra model cost. Dropped fields are surfaced as an `extraction_off_schema_fields` (info) processing issue. See the [extraction README](lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/extraction/README.md#schema-compliance-filtering-simple-mode) (GitHub #510).

### Changed

- **BDA-as-OCR project is now a per-stack resource, not an account-global one.** For the `bda` OCR backend, the standard-output SYNC project was auto-created at runtime under one hardcoded, account-wide name (`GENAIIDP-OCR-StandardOutput`), so multiple stacks in an account interfered with a single shared project. Each stack now provisions its own `<stackname>_OCR_StdOutput` project via a CloudFormation custom resource (`Custom::BDAOCRProject`) — created and deleted with the stack — and the OCR function no longer creates it at runtime. **Migration:** pre-existing `GENAIIDP-OCR-StandardOutput` projects are now orphaned (harmless) and can be deleted manually once all stacks are upgraded. See the [OCR README](lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/ocr/README.md).

- **Page viewer unified into one Visual Editor layout with an OCR-lines / Markdown toggle.** The Web UI "View/Edit Page Text" modal previously had three separate tabs (Visual Editor, Text + Markdown, Text + Confidence). It now always shows the page image on the left (when available) with a right-pane toggle between **OCR Lines** (clickable → color-coded confidence bounding box, as before) and **Markdown** (with a Rendered ↔ Raw sub-toggle; Raw is the editable surface in edit mode). The separate **Text + Confidence** tab is retired — its per-line text+confidence is already shown, color-coded, in the OCR Lines pane (and it was inoperative anyway, as `TextConfidenceUri` was never persisted to the tracking table). Page-text editing is preserved via the Raw markdown editor. See [docs/web-ui.md](docs/web-ui.md).

- **Summarization failures now surface the underlying error, not a generic wrapper.** When a section's summarization fails (e.g. a Bedrock `ResourceNotFoundException` from a retired model, or a context-window overflow), the Summarization Lambda now includes the real cause in the exception it raises to Step Functions instead of a bare `"Summarization failed for document X"`, so the failure is diagnosable from the execution error and tracking record without opening CloudWatch (GitHub #504).

- **Error Analyzer agent drills into the failing stage's own logs and no longer conflates non-fatal issues with the failure.** The troubleshooting prompt now explicitly instructs the agent to treat stage-level wrapper messages as symptoms and read the first underlying exception in the failing Lambda's log group, to not attribute a `FAILED` workflow to unrelated non-fatal `ProcessingIssue` warnings from a different stage, and (for a Bedrock model error) to call `fetch_pipeline_configuration` and name the exact configured model rather than telling the user to check it.

- **Bedrock client logs the model ID on non-retryable errors.** Non-retryable `Converse` and embedding failures now include the model ID in the log line (e.g. `Non-retryable Bedrock error for model us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0: ResourceNotFoundException - ...`), so the offending model is explicit in the function logs — Bedrock's own message for a retired model does not name it.

### Fixed

- **Feature Platform stack now honors `PermissionsBoundaryArn`, fixing rollback in SCP-enforced accounts.** When `EnableFeaturePlatform=true`, the main template did not forward `PermissionsBoundaryArn` to the Feature Platform nested stack (`feature-platform/main-stack-extensions`), and that nested template neither declared the parameter nor attached a boundary to its `FeaturePlatformLambdaRole` — so in accounts whose SCP requires a permissions boundary on every IAM role, `iam:CreateRole` was denied and the nested stack rolled back on creation. The parameter is now declared in the nested template, attached to the role, and forwarded from the main stack. The same gap on the SAM-auto-role Lambda functions in the installable feature templates (`feature-template`, `sample-feature`, `sample-health-insurance-review`) and on the conditional `BastionRole` / AgentCore roles/function in the main template is fixed as well. A static regression test (`lib/idp_sdk/tests/unit/test_permissions_boundary_coverage.py`) now asserts every deployed-stack template attaches the boundary to each role it creates and forwards the parameter to every nested stack that accepts it. (#521)


- **A failed stack update no longer wedges the automatic rollback on the config custom resource.** When an in-place update from a pre-0.6 release (e.g. 0.5.16) to 0.6.x failed for any reason and CloudFormation rolled back, the rollback itself got stuck in `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED`. The config custom resource (`UpdateConfigurationFunction`) had already migrated the stored config to the 0.6 shape; on rollback CloudFormation reverts that Lambda to the *older* release's code and re-invokes it, which then re-read the now-0.6 config and crashed — a bare `int(None)` `TypeError` on fields 0.6 stores as `null` (e.g. `max_tokens` = "request model max"), and a `gt=0` `ValidationError` on fields 0.6 stores as `0` (e.g. `extraction.agentic.shard_token_budget` = "auto-size"). Two fixes: (1) the DynamoDB serializer now **omits scalar fields whose value equals their default and is `None` or integer `0`** — behavior-neutral for the current model (absent == default on read) but sparing the reverted older model from values it cannot parse (verified: every bundled config now parses cleanly under the 0.5.16 model, with a lossless 0.6 round-trip); and (2) the custom resource now **detects a rollback** (a stored `config_format_version` newer than the running code's) and returns SUCCESS instead of FAILED on a parse error, letting the rollback complete rather than wedging the stack — while a genuine forward bad-config still fails loudly. Note: only managed/default config records are rewritten at deploy time; user Custom and named config versions are untouched. See the [config module README](lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/config/README.md).

- **OpenAI (bedrock-mantle) metering no longer double-counts cached tokens.** OpenAI's Responses `usage.input_tokens` is the *total* prompt count and already **includes** the cached / cache-write tokens as a subset — unlike Bedrock Converse, where `inputTokens` is the disjoint uncached count. The mantle usage mapper reported that total as `inputTokens` while *also* emitting `cacheReadInputTokens` / `cacheWriteInputTokens`, so the cost calculator billed cached tokens twice (full input rate **and** cache rate) — turning the cache discount into a ~64% overcharge on warm calls. `inputTokens` is now the disjoint fresh count (`input_tokens − cached − cache_write`), so `inputTokens + cacheReadInputTokens` reconciles to the true prompt size. Affects all GPT-5.x models (5.4 / 5.5 / 5.6). Verified live end-to-end. See the [bedrock module README](lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/bedrock/README.md#openai-gpt-5x-models-bedrock-mantle-responses-api). (#519)

- **Addressed package vulnerabilities flagged by recent dependency scans.** Upgraded affected direct and transitive dependencies across the Python library (`lib/idp_common_pkg`), the fcc dataset deployer Lambda, the web UI (`src/ui`), the docs site, and the feature-platform UIs to their patched versions.

- **BDA-as-OCR no longer drops table-cell text/confidence/geometry from `pageData.json`.** When Amazon Bedrock Data Automation is used as the OCR engine (`ocr.backend: bda`), BDA leaves the line-level text empty on table-cell lines (the content lives only in the child words). The BDA→Textract-block converter copied that emptiness onto the LINE block, and the shared `pageData.json` builder drops empty-text LINE blocks — so all table-cell content (and its confidence/geometry) was silently stripped from the Page viewer's OCR lines and from `textConfidence.json`, even though it rendered fine in the extracted markdown. The converter now synthesizes the line text from its child words, so table cells survive with their word-level confidence and bounding boxes intact (verified: recovers all lines to match the Textract OCR variant). See the [OCR README](lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/ocr/README.md). (#513)

- **`rvl-cdip-package-sample` no longer fails at the Summarization stage on a retired model.** The config pinned `us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0` for OCR and Summarization, which Bedrock has since retired (end-of-life); every Summarization `Converse` call returned `ResourceNotFoundException` and failed the whole document. The preset is now reduced to only its custom `classes` (plus a `notes` label) and inherits every other section — OCR, classification, extraction, assessment/confidence, summarization, evaluation, discovery, and agents — from the current system defaults, so it always uses supported models and the latest prompts instead of drifting onto retired ones.

- **Error Analyzer agent can now read stack logs on Lambda cold starts.** The SSM settings cache (`monitoring/settings_cache.py`) used `time.monotonic()` against a `0.0` "never-loaded" sentinel to decide expiry. On a cold-start Lambda microVM, `monotonic()` is often below the cache TTL, so the never-loaded cache was wrongly treated as fresh, the SSM refresh was skipped, and settings (including `CloudWatchLogGroups`) came back empty — the agent then reported "log groups inaccessible / not found in SSM Settings" and could not find the underlying error. The cache now treats a never-loaded state as always-expired regardless of the monotonic clock (GitHub #504 follow-up).

- **Assessment no longer wastes a model escalation (or hard-fails a document) on a schema mismatch.** When extraction returned list-valued data for an attribute the class schema does not define as an array, the confidence enhancer collapsed it to a single default leaf, leaving every row "unscored" — and the self-healing ladder then escalated to a stronger confidence model that re-emitted the same list and recovered **0 rows**, marking the section `assessment_incomplete` (error) and failing the document. The ladder now detects this schema mismatch, **skips both retry and escalation** for the field (a stronger model cannot fix a schema mismatch), and emits a clear `assessment_schema_mismatch` (error) processing issue naming the field(s) and the real fix (correct the schema/extraction, or use Advanced extraction) instead of a misleading "escalation failed" story. Paired with the simple-mode off-schema filter above, the offending field is normally dropped at extraction so the section no longer fails at all. See the [assessment README](lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/assessment/README.md) (GitHub #510).

- **HITL "Skip All Reviews" now finalizes the document like completing the last section.** Skipping all pending sections previously updated tracking status but did **not** trigger downstream reprocessing, so Summarization/Evaluation never re-ran and the optional post-processing Lambda hook (`PostProcessingLambdaHookFunctionArn`) never fired — inconsistent with the section-by-section completion path, which does. `skip_all_sections_review` now calls the same `trigger_reprocessing` used when the final section is completed, so both "finish review" paths behave identically. See [docs/human-review.md](docs/human-review.md).

## [0.6.0]

This release (v0.6) reframes **per-field confidence and bounding-box geometry as
outputs of extraction** rather than a separate assessment stage, retires the
granular assessment service, adds robust large-list / large-document handling, and
completes the AWS AppSync → API Gateway transport migration. **Existing v0.5 configs
are migrated automatically on read — no manual edit is required.** See the
[Extraction & Confidence guide](docs/extraction-and-confidence.md), the
[Granular Assessment Retirement note](docs/migration-granular-retirement.md), and the
[AppSync → REST migration guide](docs/migration-appsync-to-rest.md).

### Added



- **Integrated confidence — per-field confidence produced inside extraction, no separate assessment pass.** `confidence.mode: integrated` emits each value's confidence in the extraction inference itself (then enriches with per-field thresholds/alerts, grounds geometry, and writes the same `explainability_info` contract, so downstream evaluation/reporting/UI/HITL are unchanged and the standalone Assessment step auto-skips). On Simple mode this uses a single **1S-TopK** call that asks the model for its top-K guesses with probabilities — better-calibrated than single-value self-assessment — halving extraction-workflow LLM calls. Works on both the Advanced (agentic) and Simple paths. See the [Extraction & Confidence guide](docs/extraction-and-confidence.md#confidence-mode-separate-vs-integrated-vs-off).

- **Reliable, low-cost confidence assessment for large lists.** Large-list confidence is now complete and cheap on the first pass: batch sizes are auto-derived from the confidence model's output cap (so a small-cap model like Nova Lite no longer truncates), independent batches run concurrently after one cache-warming call, page images are dropped from the prompt in OCR-geometry modes, truncated responses are salvaged (valid prefix kept, only the remainder re-scored), and any still-unscored rows escalate to a stronger model. All of this is bounded by the Lambda wall-clock budget and checkpointed to S3 so a shard resumes without repeating extraction. Activity is recorded in `assessment_batch_split_stats` and the processing report. See the [assessment README](lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/assessment/README.md).

- **Document versions — every processing run is retained, comparable, and downloadable.** Re-uploading or reprocessing a document (same S3 key) no longer discards prior results: each successful run is snapshotted as an immutable version (pinned S3 object versions in a per-run manifest). The document detail page gains a **Version History** panel to view, compare, and (Admin-only) delete past versions; the CLI adds `idp-cli list-versions` and `download-results --run-id`; and the API adds `listDocumentVersions`/`getDocumentVersion`/`compareDocumentVersions`/`deleteDocumentVersion`. Enabled by default, retained for `DataRetentionInDays`. See the [Document Versions guide](docs/document-versions.md).

- **Quick Start — cold-start configuration authoring for new deployments.** A conversational agent bootstraps a working configuration for first-time users: describe your document type in natural language, or attach example documents to run Discovery and infer document classes automatically. It authors an extraction schema, matches bundled sample configs (citing them as inline links to the real documents), and writes a new configuration version you can refine in chat. Surfaced via a floating widget and a Welcome page; gated by `EnableQuickStartWidget`; also available from the CLI (`idp-cli bootstrap`). See the [Quick Start guide](docs/quick-start.md).

- **API Gateway Web UI hosting (`WebUIHosting=APIGateway`) — private/VPC-capable UI without CloudFront.** A new hosting option serves the React SPA as an S3 proxy on the existing api-resolvers REST API, on the same stage as the data operations, so the UI inherits the API's network posture: set `ApiGatewayVisibility=PRIVATE` (with `DeployInVPC=true` + VPC params) for a VPC-only UI, and the optional WAF IP allow-list covers it too. No ALB, ACM certificate, or S3 VPC endpoint required. See the [API Gateway Hosting guide](docs/apigateway-hosting.md).

- **`--govcloud` publish/deploy option — full Web UI in GovCloud.** `idp-cli publish`/`deploy` gain a `--govcloud` flag that transforms the template to remove every CloudFront resource (unavailable in GovCloud) and forces `WebUIHosting=APIGateway`, serving the full interactive Web UI as an S3 proxy on the REST API — unlike `--headless`, which removes the UI entirely. Chat still works without live streaming (the UI polls for the final answer). The tooling runs a region-aware `cfn-lint` on the transformed template and fails the build on any GovCloud-unsupported-resource error. Requires the API Gateway hosting option. See the [GovCloud Deployment guide](docs/govcloud-deployment.md#keeping-the-web-ui-in-govcloud---govcloud).

- **BDA as a pure OCR engine (`ocr.backend: bda`).** Amazon Bedrock Data Automation "standard output" can be used as an OCR-only engine feeding the normal classification/extraction pipeline — distinct from whole-pipeline BDA mode (`use_bda`). It returns reading-order markdown with tables/layout plus word-level confidence and bounding boxes at a flat $10/1,000 pages, auto-enables the agentic table tool, and is adapted to Textract response format so it flows through the existing confidence/geometry path. Choose it for table-heavy documents and predictable pricing. See the [OCR README](lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/ocr/README.md).

- **Lower-cost agentic extraction on table-heavy documents (up to ~57% cheaper, no accuracy change).** The deterministic table tools now return only a compact model-visible summary (full rows kept in agent state, read directly by downstream tools) so dense rows are no longer re-transmitted every turn, and a new `extraction.agentic.table_parsing.lazy_images` knob (default `true`) skips pre-loading page images when a table parse succeeds (the agent can still fetch a page on demand). Set `lazy_images: false` for image-dependent corpora. See the [Extraction & Confidence guide](docs/extraction-and-confidence.md).

- **Bounding-box OCR grounding is ~30× faster on large tables (indexed match).** Grounding now builds a cached normalized-line list + an exact-text index per page and does an index-first pass, falling back to the fuzzy ladder only when nothing matched verbatim — cutting a 1,440-row section from ~64s to ~2s with byte-identical output.

- **Claude Sonnet 5 is selectable everywhere** (`us`/`eu`/`global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5`, plus `:1m` extended-context variants) — registered in the model picklists, pricing, output-token limits (128K), prompt-cache support, and Bedrock TPM quota codes. Sonnet 5 rejects non-default sampling params, so IDP strips them automatically. **Request Anthropic Claude Sonnet 5 access in Bedrock before selecting it.**

- **Reasoning effort is configurable for reasoning-capable Claude models (extraction defaults to `low`).** `reasoning_effort` drives Claude's `output_config.effort` on the Bedrock Converse path for effort-capable models (Sonnet 5, Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.5–4.8, Fable 5), wired through both standard and agentic extraction; the config UI shows the selector only when the model supports it. A full sweep found higher effort adds output-token cost with negligible accuracy gain, so `low` keeps the Sonnet 5 default affordable.

- **Processing transparency — structured issues surfaced in the UI and report.** A new `ProcessingIssue` concept (stage, severity, code, message, root cause) is attached to each section, rolled up to the document, and rendered in the web UI (a Status column on the Sections panel with a hover popover, a Processing Issues column on the document list) and at the top of the section Processing Report. So a document that self-healed with retries — or one where a row genuinely couldn't be scored — is visible at a glance instead of only in `result.json`. The report also surfaces how the document was processed (model window, context buffer, auto-derived shard/batch sizes, batch counts + concurrency, a process-flow visual), and an under-producing extraction is honestly flagged `extraction_incomplete` rather than a misleading SUCCESS.

- **Bundled sample documents are deployable and launchable from the web UI, with one-click matching configuration.** The curated `samples/` documents are published to the ConfigurationBucket at deploy time. The Upload Documents panel gains a Document source toggle to pick a bundled sample and process it without downloading it first; when a sample is tuned for a Configuration Library preset that isn't imported yet, a pre-checked option imports that preset as a new config version and processes the sample with it. New operations: `listSampleDocuments`, `uploadSampleDocument`. See [web-ui.md](docs/web-ui.md#upload-documents).

- **In-app feedback & GitHub issue reporting.** Users can report bugs or request features on the project's public GitHub repository directly from the web UI, with deployment details and document/agent context pre-filled into the issue body. Entry points: a Feedback menu in the top nav, a "Report this issue on GitHub" button in the Error Analyzer Troubleshoot modal, a "Create GitHub issue" button in the Agent Companion Chat, and side-nav/help-panel links. Nothing is submitted automatically — GitHub always shows the pre-filled form to review first, with a reminder to redact sensitive data. See [web-ui.md](docs/web-ui.md#feedback--issue-reporting). (#489)

- **View/Edit Configuration UX improvements.** The config editor de-clutters its toolbar (secondary actions collapse into an Actions menu), adds tooltips explaining disabled actions, shows the unsaved-changes banner + Discard on all versions, restores deep-link URLs on navigation, renders prompts in taller textareas with an Expand-editor modal, requires a confirmation modal to delete a version, and shows a word-level inline diff when comparing two versions. The Document Schema builder adds Export all/selected, an "Add another" attribute flow, and a graphical entity-relationship Diagram preview of the classes. See [web-ui.md](docs/web-ui.md) and [configuration-versions.md](docs/configuration-versions.md). (#482, #484)

- **Discovery: create a new configuration version inline, and a "Replace" save mode.** The Discovery panels gain a **Create new version** modal (inheriting settings and classes from a chosen source version) and a **Save mode** control: *Add to existing schema* (default) or *Replace existing schema*, which clears the target version's document classes once up front before saving only the newly discovered ones. Threaded through the discovery mutations via a new optional `saveMode` argument. See the [Discovery guide](docs/discovery.md#web-ui-interface).

- **"View / Edit Model Limits" page — per-model token limits editable at runtime.** The ordered, first-match-wins model limits list (`config_library/model_config_limits.yaml`) is now seeded into the DynamoDB Configuration Table at deploy and surfaced in a new Admin-editable page (Table/JSON/YAML views, row reordering, import/export, restore-defaults, a "Test a model ID" tool). Edits take real effect via a 60-second runtime cache; `config_library/model_config_limits.yaml` is now the single source of truth (the copy bundled in the wheel is removed). New operations: `getModelConfigLimits`, `updateModelConfigLimits`, `restoreDefaultModelConfigLimits`.

- **`DATE` evaluation method for format-insensitive date comparison.** Upgraded the evaluation engine to `stickler-eval` 0.5.0 and exposed its `DateComparator` as a first-class method (`x-aws-idp-evaluation-method: DATE`): it parses both values into dates before comparing, so `01/05/2024`, `2024-01-05`, and `January 5, 2024` all match, and understands date ranges. All `format: date` fields across the bundled presets are switched to it (time-only and free-text fields intentionally left on their prior methods). See the [evaluation guide](docs/evaluation.md).

- **`idp-cli deploy --tags "key=value,..."`** — applies CloudFormation stack-level tags at deploy time, propagated to all nested stacks/resources for governance and cost allocation. See [Resource tagging](docs/idp-cli.md#resource-tagging).

- **`idp-cli config-validate --emit-migrated <path>`** — writes a config migrated to the current format (v0.5 → v0.6) to a file so you can review the v0.6-shaped result before importing. See [config-validate](docs/idp-cli.md#config-validate).

- **CLI/SDK: promote a processed document to the evaluation baseline.** New `idp-cli use-as-baseline --stack-name <s> --document-id <key>` command and `client.evaluation.use_as_baseline(...)` SDK method — the scriptable equivalent of the UI button; runs synchronously and returns the file count.

- **API RBAC test system — static scan + live authorization harness (`make api-test`).** A two-layer, auditable test system that verifies every UI API operation is protected by its required Cognito group(s) and, where applicable, config-version scope. `make api-test-static` runs with no AWS (CI-safe), cross-checking the operation universe against schema directives and a single source-of-truth expectations file; `make api-test STACK_NAME=<stack>` drives a deployed stack with temporary per-role Cognito users (plus unauthenticated and tampered-token calls) and writes a JSON/Markdown report. Documented as a skill (`.claude/skills/api-rbac-test.md`); this harness found the config-version scope fail-open fixed in this release.

- **Feature SDK: shell-free structured build/package commands in `feature.yaml`.** The feature manifest gains structured step-list forms `ui.build` and `agentSource.package` — each step an `{argv, cwd}` object executed with `shell=False` — eliminating the shell command-injection surface (Bandit B602). The legacy single-string command forms remain supported but are deprecated. See [the SDK README](lib/idp_feature_sdk/README.md#build--package-commands-in-featureyaml).

- **API Gateway logging at `LogLevel` INFO/DEBUG (metadata only, no payloads).** When `LogLevel` is INFO or DEBUG, the web UI's REST API stage enables CloudWatch **access** logging (request metadata only — never bodies — capturing failures before the dispatcher: authorizer 401/403s, WAF blocks, CORS/gateway responses) and **execution** logging at `LoggingLevel: ERROR` with `DataTraceEnabled: false` (deliberately not INFO, which would echo document payloads). Logs go to stack-managed, KMS-encrypted groups honoring `LogRetentionDays`. At WARN/ERROR (recommended for production) no access logging is configured, matching prior behavior. Resolves SRT finding API-GW-006. (#481, #488)

- **CI coverage: package/Lambda test suites and the GovCloud ARN check now run in CI.** Two gaps closed. The MR `developer_tests` job previously ran only the `idp_common_pkg` suite plus the UI vitest tests; a new `make test-packages-cicd` target adds the ~665 tests that were green headless but never exercised in CI — `idp_cli_pkg`, `idp_sdk`, `idp_feature_sdk`, the feature-platform resolver/template suites, the capacity-planning and circuit-breaker Lambdas, the chat processors, and the `config_library` validation — so a regression in any of them fails the MR. Separately, the `check-arn-partitions` guard (which fails on hardcoded `arn:aws:` / service principals that break GovCloud) was wired into `lint-cicd`; it had been present in the local `lint`/`fastlint` targets but not in the target CI runs, so a hardcoded partition could previously pass CI.

- **CI pipeline: fail-fast security gate, automatic root-cause analysis for failed deployments, failure email, and API RBAC tests in the gate.** Four CI improvements to the GitLab + CodeBuild test pipeline. (1) The SRT security scan now runs on the same branch pipelines as the integration tests (develop/feature/fix — previously it only ran on MR pipelines, so the two never shared a pipeline) and is ordered before the ~2h `integration_tests` stage with `needs: []`, so a pipeline that will fail the security gate fails in minutes, not hours. (2) The Bedrock-generated deployment summary now always explains *why* a run failed: the Step 4b API Gateway/VPC hosting test — which previously ran *after* the summary was generated, so its failures produced a bare "deployment failed!" line with a stale all-green summary — gets its own AI root-cause section from CloudFormation failure events captured *before* the throwaway stack is torn down; the GitLab job's CodeBuild log fetch is fully paginated (a single `get-log-events` call truncates 2h builds); and the build uploads the summary to S3 under a deterministic key (`deploy/summaries/<build-id>.txt`) so the GitLab job reads it directly instead of scraping logs (`deployment_summary.txt` is now a job artifact). The final failure line includes the failure reason (e.g. `💥 Stack: … deployment failed! — API Gateway/VPC hosting deploy failed`). (3) A new optional `FailureNotificationEmail` parameter on the SDLC pipeline template creates an SNS topic + email subscription; the build publishes the AI failure summary to it, so the pass/fail email contains the root cause. (4) The API RBAC tests join the gate at both layers: `make api-test-static` runs in the MR `developer_tests` job (no AWS needed), and the live harness runs as a new sequential Step 12 (`make api-test`) against the freshly deployed integration-test stack (sequential because it temporarily toggles the Cognito app-client auth flows); the pipeline's CodeBuild role gains the scoped Cognito permissions the harness needs.

### Changed

- **Config format v0.6: confidence & geometry are outputs of extraction; HITL is its own section (auto-migrated on read).** The former top-level `assessment` block is retired as the home for confidence scoring — settings move under `extraction.confidence.*` / `extraction.geometry.*`, and `assessment.hitl_*` moves to a new top-level `hitl.*`. Existing v0.5 configs are migrated automatically by an idempotent transform at both config-import and deploy-time merge, so custom configs and presets keep working unchanged. The config UI is reorganized to match (top-level Extraction mode, Confidence/Geometry mode selectors, and a new HITL Review section). See the [Extraction & Confidence guide](docs/extraction-and-confidence.md).

- **AWS AppSync fully removed — replaced by an API Gateway REST API + polling + Lambda response streaming.** The UI↔backend transport no longer uses AppSync (unavailable in GovCloud, not FedRAMP-compliant). Queries/mutations go through a REST API with a Cognito authorizer (supporting `ApiGatewayVisibility=PRIVATE` and an optional WAF WebACL); status updates poll; the two chat flows stream via a Lambda Function URL. Parameters `AppSyncVisibility`/`UsePrivateAppSync` are renamed to **`ApiGatewayVisibility`/`UsePrivateApi`**. See the [AppSync → REST migration guide](docs/migration-appsync-to-rest.md).

- **ALB Web UI hosting (`WebUIHosting=ALB`) removed — replaced by API Gateway hosting.** The internal-ALB hosting mode, the `nested/alb-hosting/` stack, and all `ALB*` parameters have been deleted. **Migration:** switch `WebUIHosting=ALB` → `WebUIHosting=APIGateway`; for the equivalent private posture also set `ApiGatewayVisibility=PRIVATE` + `DeployInVPC=true` and the VPC params. No ACM certificate, ALB, or S3 VPC endpoint needed. The application URL changes from the ALB DNS name to the execute-api `/api/` URL. See the [API Gateway Hosting guide](docs/apigateway-hosting.md).

- **Granular assessment is retired and its service deleted.** The `GranularAssessmentService` and the `extraction.confidence.granular` config field no longer exist. Large-list assessment is now handled by standalone batching (`extraction.confidence.list_batch_size`, default 25) with a bounded missing-row retry to reach 100% per-cell coverage — ~78% cheaper than granular on a 120-row bank statement with equal accuracy. **Migration is a no-op:** leftover `granular.*` keys still validate and are ignored. See [Granular Assessment Retirement](docs/migration-granular-retirement.md).

- **Default extraction model is now Claude Sonnet 5; default confidence model is Amazon Nova Lite.** Sonnet 5 gives the best extraction quality; confidence stays on the far cheaper Nova Lite because a live A/B measured ~$0.0011/doc vs ~$0.145/doc (~130×) for the assessment pass, where output tokens dominate cost. Presets that pin an explicit model are unaffected. **Request Anthropic Claude Sonnet 5 access in Bedrock before upgrading.**

- **Advanced (agentic) extraction shards large documents reliably on a Step Functions Distributed Map.** Sharding engages by default on large docs (token and page-count bounds per shard), each shard persists idempotently to S3 so SFN retries re-run only failed shards, and confidence assessment + bounding-box grounding run inside each shard (scaling with extraction) before a merge step reconciles to the exact row count. Shard token budgets and confidence batch sizes are derived from each model's context/output window minus a single `extraction.context_buffer` (default 30%), so per-model hand-tuning is no longer required. See the [Extraction & Confidence guide](docs/extraction-and-confidence.md#large-document-guidance).

- **`max_tokens` is now optional everywhere — leave it empty to use the model's maximum output limit.** Every service treats `max_tokens` as an optional cap resolved from `model_config_limits.yaml` when unset; extraction and confidence always request the model's maximum (their `max_tokens` fields are removed — leftover values ignored, no migration needed) because completeness matters more than an output cap. Set a positive value only to cap below the model max. In the config UI the advanced inference params are grouped into a collapsed "Model parameters" section. See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md).

- **OCR-only geometry is the default (`geometry.mode: ocr_only`).** Field bounding boxes are derived by matching extracted values to real OCR lines in `pageData.json` instead of asking the model for coordinates — cheaper (no bbox tokens) and more accurate (no hallucinated boxes); repeated values are disambiguated by row order and matching is format-aware. LLM-box modes (`llm`, `llm_grounded`) remain available. See the [Extraction & Confidence guide](docs/extraction-and-confidence.md#geometry--bounding-boxes).

- **Textract `TABLES` is enabled by default in OCR (`ocr.features: [TABLES, LAYOUT]`).** Tables are common and the accuracy gain is large: on a 24-page brokerage statement `TABLES` extracted all 1,440 rows where `LAYOUT`-only silently dropped ~5 pages. `TABLES`+`LAYOUT` (~$0.065/page) costs ~16× the Textract line-item of `LAYOUT`-only but is typically more cost-effective end-to-end for documents *with* tables. For a table-free corpus, remove the `TABLES` entry to fall back to cheaper `LAYOUT`-only. See [Configuration → Textract features](docs/configuration.md).

- **Confidence prompts emit `confidence_reason` only for lower-confidence leaves (below 0.9), capped at ~12 words.** A high-confidence value returns just `{"confidence": <score>}`. Because output tokens dominate assessment cost, this cuts output substantially with no change to scores, thresholds, or alerts. To restore a reason on every field, widen the 0.9 threshold in the confidence `task_prompt`.

- **Config editor now shows per-step guidance and a consistent enable-toggle label.** Each processing-step section renders a short description explaining what it does and when it is skipped, the deterministic table parser's OCR dependency is called out in its heading, and the enable toggle is labeled "Enabled" consistently. Schema-metadata + UI-rendering only — no processing-logic change.

- **Evaluation reports show the per-field comparison Method and Weight for nested list/object fields.** Each item field of an array-of-objects (e.g. `LineItems[].Amount`) now displays its own comparator Method and Weight in the Nested Field Comparison table and the Visual Editor overlay, consistent with the top-level attributes table. These are re-derived on read from the translated schema (Stickler drops them from its output), so no re-run is needed. See the [evaluation guide](docs/evaluation.md).

- **GovCloud Deployment guide restructured around the two `idp-cli` paths (`--govcloud` with the Web UI vs. `--headless`).** `docs/govcloud-deployment.md` now opens with a decision table and copy-paste `idp-cli deploy` commands for each variant, corrects a stale claim that `--headless` auto-sets `EnableHeadless=true`, and links to the rewritten GovCloud Architecture page (which documents both variants and corrects the "Pattern 2 only" claim — BDA mode is available in `us-gov-west-1`).

### Fixed

- **Failed and timed-out Step Functions steps were shown as "Running" in the execution view.** The step-history parser's failure handlers (`TaskFailed` / `TaskTimedOut` / `LambdaFunctionFailed`) looked up the affected step by its display *name*, but the correlation helper returns a step *key* (`<name>_<eventId>`); the two never matched, so a failed step was never transitioned out of `RUNNING`. The web UI's execution detail therefore rendered a genuinely-failed step as still running. The handlers now match on key-or-name. (`get_stepfunction_execution_resolver`.)

- **`make test` now runs every test suite (auto-discovered), and the test-runner won't let new suites be silently skipped.** `make test` was a hand-maintained directory list, so ~200 tests across ~22 Lambda/resolver dirs were never run by it. A single root-level `pytest` can't replace it (the many `tests/conftest.py` files collide), so `scripts/run_all_tests.py` runs each test root as an isolated invocation but **discovers** the roots and fails if any discovered directory isn't explicitly registered as run-or-quarantined — closing the gap that let new tests go unrun. New targets: `make test`, `make test-integration-all`, `make test-list`. Also fixed `save_reporting_data`'s tests (they reached real AWS and asserted a stale call signature).

- **`idp_common` unit gate now runs the full unit suite (~810 more tests) instead of only `@pytest.mark.unit`-tagged ones.** `lib/idp_common_pkg`'s `test-unit`/`test-cicd` targets filtered on `-m "unit"`, but hundreds of real unit tests were never tagged with that marker, so CI silently collected only ~1,564 of ~2,374 tests. The filter is now `-m "not integration"` (matching `pytest.ini`'s default and the rest of the repo), and the 28 tests that had rotted while unrun are fixed so the wider suite is green: obsolete `sync_custom_with_new_default` auto-merge assertions rewritten to the current no-op snapshot contract; stale default-model/compression assertions in the discovery embedding/visual-tool tests updated (and made to use real images); the "missing assessment section" test moved to the v0.6 `extraction.confidence.task_prompt` location; `test_publish` environment tests de-mocked of a since-removed private method; a flaky concurrent-batch embedding test made order-independent (its mock keyed on input rather than call order); and two mislabeled discovery integration tests marked `@pytest.mark.integration` like their siblings. Two module-level `sys.modules` mocks (`pypdfium2` in the OCR test, `PIL` in the assessment test) were leaking globally and corrupting later test files that build real PDFs/images — they now only fall back to a `MagicMock` when the real module is genuinely absent.

- **Reasoning models (Claude Sonnet 5, Sonnet/Opus 4.6+, any model with extended thinking) returned empty extractions/classifications.** These models emit `reasoningContent` blocks before the answer `text` block, but the parsers read only `content[0].get("text")` — the reasoning block — yielding an empty string and silent 0% accuracy. The parsers now concatenate all `text` blocks and skip `reasoningContent`. Affected extraction, classification, assessment, and summarization.

- **Config-version scope was silently unenforced for configuration reads (fail-open).** The `ConfigurationResolverFunction`'s IAM policy granted DynamoDB access only to the ConfigurationTable, not the UsersTable, so every `allowedConfigVersions` lookup failed with `AccessDeniedException` — which the resolver treats as "no restriction", silently granting a config-version-scoped non-admin user unrestricted access to every configuration version. The role now grants `Query`/`GetItem` on the UsersTable and its indexes. Found by the new API RBAC test harness (`make api-test`).

- **Reviewers can save section edits again in the Visual Editor (HITL review).** Saving as a Reviewer failed with `Not Authorized to access uploadDocument` because the save path requested a presigned upload URL via a mutation restricted to Admin/Author. The reviewer save now routes through the reviewer-permitted `completeSectionReview` mutation, which writes the edited JSON server-side; the resolver raises instead of silently succeeding when the output URI can't be resolved. Admin/Author keep the presigned path.

- **Confidence assessment no longer silently loses scores + bounding boxes when the model truncates its output.** A large per-row assessment batch could exceed a small-cap confidence model's max output tokens (e.g. Nova Lite's 10,000), yielding unparseable JSON that was silently replaced with a default `0.5` and null placeholders. The core now detects truncation (`stopReason == "max_tokens"`, plus the OpenAI-Responses `incomplete` status) and the large-list batcher recursively halves any truncated slice and re-assesses it until it fits, surfacing split activity in `metadata.assessment_batch_split_stats`.

- **Documents with `#` in their filename no longer fail with `NoSuchKey` at every processing stage.** `urlparse` treats `#` as a URL fragment delimiter and silently truncated S3 keys in `Document.decompress()`, `S3Util.s3_url_to_bucket_key()`, and the reporting data writer. All three now use `parse_s3_uri()`, which splits the URI literally and preserves any key character. (#477)

- **"View Data" / "Download" on large section results no longer fails with "Failed to load content".** The section-data viewer fetched each `result.json` inline through a resolver, so a large section (e.g. a ~5.7 MB result) pushed the response past Lambda's hard 6 MB synchronous payload limit and the invocation threw. A new `getFilePresignedUrl` query returns a short-lived SigV4 presigned GET URL so the browser fetches the bytes directly from S3 — no size limit. (#458)

- **"Use as Evaluation Baseline" now actually updates the document's Evaluation status.** The copy-to-baseline resolver had code to write `EvaluationStatus` but its IAM role was missing DynamoDB write permission, so the S3 copy succeeded while every status write failed with `AccessDeniedException` (caught and swallowed), leaving the UI stuck on `NO_BASELINE`. Added a `DynamoDBCrudPolicy` on the tracking table; the document detail view now also passes `evaluationStatus` so the baseline badges appear.

- **Evaluation no longer fails a whole document when a `required` field is correctly null.** A config marking a field `required` that a document genuinely lacked raised `Field required [type=missing]` after null-stripping, zero-scoring every attribute in the section. Evaluation now clears `required` arrays (matching the auto-generated-schema path), so a missing field scores as a normal miss on that one attribute.

- **Advanced (agentic) extraction cost is reported correctly.** The Assessment step's "intelligent skip" discarded the Extraction step's Bedrock/lambda metering, making advanced modes look nearly free in cost reports; the incoming metering is now preserved.

- **Extraction prompts respect per-field date/number formats from the Document Schema** (previously a hardcoded MM/DD/YYYY instruction overrode per-field formats), and **every list/nested-list cell gets its own confidence + bounding box** (previously a single score could apply to a whole row).

## [0.5.16]

### Added

- **Consolidated OCR page data (`pageData.json`) — text + confidence + geometry in one backend-agnostic artifact** — `OcrService` now writes a per-page `pageData.json` consolidating text, confidence, and geometry into a single LINE-primary schema (optional WORD children), where `confidence` and `geometry` are independently optional so each backend contributes what it has (Textract: per-LINE/WORD box + polygon; Mistral hook: per-LINE confidence with paragraph-level boxes; Chandra/plain-LLM: text-only). Geometry is normalized 0–1; the artifact is derived in-process (no extra OCR calls) and surfaced via `Page.ocr_page_data_uri`. The Web UI Page viewer gains a **Visual Editor** view (now the default) — page image plus OCR lines, click a line to draw only its bounding box (color-coded confidence), with zoom/pan and full-document page navigation; it degrades to image-only when a backend has no geometry. Fully additive and backward-compatible: existing files and the `{OCR_TEXT_CONFIDENCE}` prompt are unchanged (zero token impact) and older documents simply lack the file. See [the OCR README](lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/ocr/README.md#consolidated-ocr-page-data-pagedatajson).

- **Mistral OCR (serverless) LambdaHook + structured confidence/geometry capture** — New sample hook `samples/lambda-hook-inference/GENAIIDP-mistral-ocr-hook/` integrates the hosted [Mistral OCR](https://mistral.ai/news/ocr-4/) API as an OCR backend via the existing LambdaHook feature — fully serverless, no SageMaker/GPU. It requests structured output and translates the response into Amazon Textract format (per-LINE confidence averaged from word scores, WORD blocks, normalized 0–1 geometry) under a new `textractBlocks` key. `OcrService` now detects `textractBlocks` on any LambdaHook OCR response and persists it as `rawText.json` + a real `textConfidence.json` (instead of the placeholder), so OCR confidence flows into Assessment and geometry into UI highlighting — exactly like native Textract. Text-only hooks (e.g. Chandra) are unaffected. Reports `usage.pages` for cost metering; `pricing.yaml` gains a `GENAIIDP-mistral-ocr-hook` entry ($0.004/page). See [docs/lambda-hook-inference.md](docs/lambda-hook-inference.md).

- **Web UI cost view: pricing match for LambdaHook (and other ARN-keyed) metering** — The Estimated Cost table now resolves unit prices with exact-then-partial matching (mirroring the backend's `_get_unit_cost`), so a generic pricing entry (e.g. `GENAIIDP-mistral-ocr-hook`) matches a metering key that embeds the full Lambda ARN. Previously the exact-match-only lookup showed `Unit Cost: None` / `N/A` for all LambdaHook usage.

- **Assessment bounding boxes grounded in real OCR geometry (`pageData.json`)** — The Assessment service now runs a post-LLM enrichment pass that matches each extracted value against the real OCR lines in `pageData.json` and, on a confident match (tiered exact → fuzzy ≥ 0.6, with spatial disambiguation when a value repeats across rows), replaces the LLM-estimated bounding box with the real OCR box. The swapped `geometry` keeps the same shape (0–1, 1-indexed page — no UI change) and adds `geometry_source` and `ocr_confidence`; the LLM `confidence`/`confidence_reason` are never touched, so HITL thresholds are unaffected. Covers standard and granular assessment via `idp_common.assessment.ocr_grounding`, gated by `assessment.ground_geometry_in_ocr` (**default on**), with the token budget unchanged. Safe fallback to prior LLM-only behavior when `pageData.json` is absent, a backend provides no geometry, or no match is found. See [docs/assessment-bounding-boxes.md](docs/assessment-bounding-boxes.md) and [the assessment README](lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/assessment/README.md).

- **Agentic extraction: full-schema validation + model escalation (Phase 1)** — Agentic extraction can validate its output against the complete class JSON Schema (including `format` keywords the generated Pydantic model doesn't enforce — `date`, `email`, `uri`, ...), collect all violations at once with readable field paths, and on failure escalate to a stronger model. New `extraction.agentic.validation` block: `enabled` (default **false** — no behavior change on upgrade), `check_formats` (default true), `fail_action` (`warn` | `escalate` | `reject`, default `escalate`), and `escalation_model`. On `escalate`, only the failing top-level fields are re-extracted (per-class override via `x-aws-idp-extraction-escalation-model`) and merged back, kept only if valid or with strictly fewer errors. Each section's `metadata` records the model used and the validation/escalation details. Editable in the Configuration UI. Note: `format: date` is ISO-8601, so the default `MM/DD/YYYY` prompt fails format checks — set `check_formats: false` or use `pattern` for non-ISO dates. See [the extraction README](lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/extraction/README.md) and `notebooks/misc/agentic-extraction-validation-and-escalation.ipynb`.

- **Per-class extraction prompt overrides (#377)** — Classes can override the global extraction prompts via two new schema extensions, `x-aws-idp-extraction-system-prompt` and `x-aws-idp-extraction-task-prompt` (absent → global prompts; fully backward compatible). The task override supports the same placeholders as the global one and composes with a configured custom-prompt Lambda (used as defaults; the Lambda still wins). This mirrors the existing per-class `x-aws-idp-extraction-model` override, letting independently-tuned single-class configs keep their prompts when merged into a multi-class config. Editable per-class in the Configuration UI. See [docs/extraction.md](docs/extraction.md).

- **Classification valid-class enforcement (#356)** — Page-level classification (`multimodalPageLevelClassification`) now validates the predicted class against the configured vocabulary and, on an out-of-vocabulary prediction, re-prompts the model with the allowed classes (up to a retry limit); exhausted retries assign a fallback class and flag a `validation_error` (no hard failure). New keys: `enforceValidClasses` (default `true`), `maxValidationRetries` (default `2`), `invalidClassFallback` (default `unclassified`), all editable in the UI. **Behavior change on upgrade:** enforcement is on by default — set `enforceValidClasses: false` to restore the prior "use as-is" behavior. Holistic packet classification is not yet covered. See [docs/classification.md](docs/classification.md) and `notebooks/misc/classification-valid-class-enforcement.ipynb`.

- **Processing Report surfaces extraction model, validation, and population metadata** — The section Visual Editor's **Processing Report** tab now renders the agentic schema-validation/escalation and completeness-heuristic metadata it previously ignored: the extraction **model** used (noting per-class overrides), a **Schema Validation & Escalation** panel (validation result, `fail_action`, escalation outcome and before→after error counts, expandable violations), and a **Field Population** panel (completeness ratio, threshold, empty fields). The "Extraction Issues Detected" banner now also fires on a failed validation or below-threshold population, so silent loss is visible at a glance. Purely additive (reads existing `metadata.*`); older sections render unchanged.

- **Per-job `configurationVersion` on the headless Jobs API (#387)** — `POST /jobs` accepts an optional `configurationVersion` to pin a specific config version per submission (enables A/B testing and gradual config migrations). The value is validated (≤128 chars, `^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$`; invalid → 422), persisted on the job record, and re-applied as `config-version` S3 metadata on each extracted file; `GET /jobs/{id}` echoes it back. Optional and defaults to `null` (identical to prior behavior); an unknown version falls back to pipeline mode. See [docs/govcloud-batch-api.md](docs/govcloud-batch-api.md).

- **Configurable Lambda architecture** — New `LambdaArchitecture` parameter (`arm64` or `x86_64`) for all unified-pattern Lambda container images, defaulting to `arm64` (Graviton) for best price-performance. Use `x86_64` when deploying with custom base images that only support AMD64. Flows through to CodeBuild (`--platform`) and the Dockerfile `FROM` suffix.

### Removed

- **Global split panel ("documents selected")** — Removed the persistent bottom split panel from the global Web UI layout (and the related components and `use-split-panel` hook). It was noisy on non-document-list pages and only provided full details for single-document selection; reintroduce as an opt-in, per-page component if needed.

### Fixed

- **Agentic extraction: `max_concurrent_batches` now actually shards the input (fixes context-window overflow on long sections)** — Concurrent batch extraction previously handed every batch agent the *whole* document and merely instructed it (in text) to ignore other pages, so raising `max_concurrent_batches` gave no context relief and multiplied token cost ~N×; long, dense sections overflowed the context window, surfacing as the misleading Strands *"insufficient messages for summarization"* error. It now shards the section into token-budgeted page ranges (`extraction.agentic.shard_token_budget`, default 8,000) bounded also by a page ceiling (`extraction.agentic.max_pages_per_shard`, default 5), each agent seeing only its pages. Splits are page-aligned (no table-row loss), page-1 text propagates to later shards as header context, and scalar fields merge first-non-null with disagreements recorded in `metadata.shard_scalar_conflicts`. Single-pass extraction (`max_concurrent_batches: 1`, the default) is unchanged. See [the extraction README](lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/extraction/README.md).

- **Agentic extraction: clear error on context-window overflow** — When an input exceeds the model's context window, the agent loop now raises an actionable message (enable concurrent sharding / lower `shard_token_budget`, enable table parsing, reduce attached page images, or use a `:1m` model) instead of the opaque *"insufficient messages for summarization"* error.

- **Agentic extraction silently dropped nested-object field values** — Class schemas with nested object (or array-of-object) properties whose names contain spaces (e.g. `"Date of Birth"`) returned `null` for nearly every nested field. `create_pydantic_model_from_json_schema` applied the alias round-trip config (`populate_by_name` / `serialize_by_alias` / `validate_by_*`) only to the top-level model, so nested sub-models dropped or mis-keyed aliased values; the config is now propagated recursively to every nested model. This also aligns nested keys with how Evaluation and Assessment look them up. PascalCase/underscore-free schemas were unaffected.

- **Agentic extraction completeness heuristic (silent-loss detection)** — After extraction, an advisory check computes the fraction of schema-defined leaf fields that came back populated and, below `extraction.agentic.validation.min_population_ratio` (default `0.5`; set `0` to disable), logs a warning and flags `metadata.population_check` (`fields_defined`, `fields_populated`, `population_ratio`, `below_threshold`, `empty_fields`). This surfaces silent loss — the nested-field bug above, or a table that extracted zero rows — that schema validation alone can't catch. Advisory only: it never fails extraction.

- **Document Data panel: no confidence shown for fields the assessment decomposed into sub-keys** — When assessment split a plain-string field (e.g. `Insurance Company`) into sub-keyed child assessments, the field had no top-level `confidence` and showed none. `getFieldConfidenceInfo` now aggregates the children using the **minimum** child confidence (worst-case signal for review) and that child's threshold. Relatedly, OCR geometry grounding now grounds such decomposed fields by matching each sub-key to its OCR line, so they get real bounding boxes on the correct page.

- **Page Viewer: selecting an OCR line jumped back to page 1** — In the Page viewer's Visual Editor, clicking a line to highlight its box reset multi-page documents to page 1 because the geometry was tagged `page: 1` (hardcoded); it now carries the page being viewed. Page navigation is also exposed as prominent **Previous Page / Next Page** footer buttons in addition to the image arrows.

- **Web UI blocked `.txt` uploads despite backend support (#373)** — The file-picker allow-list (`SUPPORTED_UPLOAD_EXTENSIONS`) omitted `.txt` even though OCR already processes plain text, forcing users to upload directly to S3. Added `.txt` to the allow-list and the supported-formats label. Discovery upload remains intentionally PDF/image-only.

- **`idp-feature-cli deploy-pack` was create-only (#383)** — `deploy_pack()` called `create_stack(..., OnFailure="DELETE")` unconditionally, so re-running it against an existing wrapper stack failed with `AlreadyExistsException` (forcing a full delete/recreate, ~20 min). It now delegates to `create_or_update_stack()`: creates if absent, updates in place if present, treats a no-op update as success, and refuses to update a `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`/`ROLLBACK_FAILED` stack with a clear "delete it first" message. The wrapper's host custom resource treats `Update` as a no-op so the running host is undisturbed. See [the SDK README](lib/idp_feature_sdk/README.md).

### Changed

- **Extraction config UX: progressive disclosure + surfaced hidden options** — The agentic-extraction config in View/Edit Config now uses `dependsOn` to progressively disclose options (agentic sub-options only when agentic is on, table-parsing thresholds only when the parser is on, validation sub-fields only when validation is on, escalation model only when `fail_action: escalate`), with clarified labels and help text. Three previously YAML-only options are now surfaced: `table_parsing.max_empty_line_gap`, `table_parsing.auto_merge_adjacent_tables`, and the `missing_field_handling` block. Presentation-only — no keys renamed or removed; stored configs and evaluation baselines load unchanged. See [the extraction README](lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/extraction/README.md).

- **Web UI CloudFront origin access: OAI → OAC (#369)** — The CloudFront-hosted Web UI now reads its S3 origin via **Origin Access Control (OAC)** instead of the legacy Origin Access Identity; `WebUIBucketPolicy` grants `s3:GetObject` to the `cloudfront.amazonaws.com` principal scoped by an `AWS:SourceArn` condition. This fixes a **403 / Access Denied** loading the UI in accounts whose org SCP or data-perimeter guardrails block legacy OAI requests. Upgrade is in-place and non-disruptive (same domain name); gated on `WebUIHosting=CloudFront`, so GovCloud and ALB deployments are unchanged.

## [0.5.15]

### Added

- **Feature Platform — installable features ("marketplace of extensions")** — The main stack can now host *installable features*: independent CloudFormation stacks that an admin launches into the same account, which upload their UI bundle into the host's `WebUIBucket` and register themselves in a new `InstalledFeatures` DynamoDB table. Registered features appear as nav items in an "Extensions" section of the existing web UI, each rendering its own UMD-loaded React bundle via a shared host-globals contract (`window.IdpFeatures.register`). Backed by a nested `FeaturePlatformStack` (under `feature-platform/main-stack-extensions/`) exposing AppSync operations for catalog listing, entitlement, install/uninstall, and registration. Two feature kinds are distinguished by a `source` field: **OSS features** (bundled, open-source — installed via a plain CloudFormation quick-create URL) and **Marketplace features** (closed-source, *future* — handed out as a presigned URL only after `GetEntitlements` confirms an AWS Marketplace subscription; none ship today). Discovery is **manifest-driven**: `idp-cli publish` writes a single `catalog.json` into the stack's own ConfigurationBucket, read at runtime with one `GetObject` (no `ListObjectsV2`; the deployed stack does not depend on the artifacts bucket for the catalog). **On by default** (`EnableFeaturePlatform=true`) in **auto-subscribe** mode (every catalog feature treated as subscribed, UI goes straight to Install); set `FeaturePlatformSimulatorEndpoint` to attach a marketplace-simulator or real Marketplace endpoint, or `EnableFeaturePlatform=false` to remove the platform entirely. Features can also ship a **config preset** — applied at install as a new, non-active config version (`<featureId>-v<version>`) for an admin to activate, so installation never changes the active configuration — via IAM-auth AppSync mutations `applyFeatureConfigPreset` / `removeFeatureConfigPreset`. The main stack re-exports `OutputBucketName`, `WorkingBucketName`, and `DiscoveryBucketName` for features that read processing results or drive the host's Rules Discovery flow. See the new [Feature Platform](docs/feature-platform.md) and [Developer Guide](docs/feature-platform-developer-guide.md).
  - **Bundled OSS samples** — **Sample: Health Insurance Review** (`feature-platform/sample-health-insurance-review/`) demonstrates a health-insurance-claims vertical end-to-end: it applies a prior-auth rule-validation config preset, registers a `postRuleValidation` pipeline hook that derives a deterministic claim status (Clean Claim / Review Required / Insufficient Documentation) into its own DynamoDB table, exposes a multi-route Cognito-auth feature API, and renders a two-tab UI (Claims Dashboard with per-rule drill-down + a Rules Discovery tab driving the host's discovery operations via the shared Amplify instance). The minimal **Sample: Document Status** (`docs-by-status`) remains the contract reference. See [Sample: Health Insurance Review](docs/extensions/sample-health-insurance-review.md).
  - **`idp-feature-cli`** — authors scaffold features with `init`, publish artifacts with `publish`, and use `deploy` (the per-extension analogue of `idp-cli deploy`) to build, publish, and create-or-update one feature's stack against a running host for fast inner-loop iteration. Requires the AWS SAM CLI. See the [Developer Guide](docs/feature-platform-developer-guide.md).

- **Pipeline hooks — extension points in the unified workflow** — The unified Step Functions workflow now invokes a `PipelineHooksDispatcherFunction` at six post-step extension points (`postOcr`, `postClassification`, `postExtraction`, `postAssessment`, `postRuleValidation`, `postSummarization`). The dispatcher reads the active configuration version's `<step>.postHook` list from the ConfigurationTable and fans out to feature-registered hook Lambdas in `order`, passing the document/section payload. Hooks are **inert by default**: with no `postHook` config the dispatcher returns after a single DDB read and the pipeline is unchanged. Hook Lambdas must either carry the `idp:feature-id` resource tag (ABAC for vertical-product packs) or follow the `GENAIIDP-*` naming convention — anything else fails closed with `AccessDenied`. Each SFN hook state is catch-all so a missing or erroring hook never breaks the pipeline; per-hook `onError` policy (`continue`/`skip-remaining`/`fail`) is configurable. This is the foundational extension point for the Feature Platform (installable subscription features) but is independently useful for injecting custom business logic mid-pipeline.
  
- **Custom domain support for ALB-hosted private deployments** — new optional `CustomDomainUrl` stack parameter (under the *ALB Hosting* parameter group) lets the Web UI be reached through a customer-owned DNS alias, an Okta/SAML/OIDC SSO domain, or any other origin in front of the ALB **without losing access via the original ALB URL**. When set:
  - the custom origin is added to the `AllowedOrigins` of all seven browser-accessed S3 buckets (`InputBucket`, `OutputBucket`, `ConfigurationBucket`, `ReportingBucket`, `EvaluationBaselineBucket`, `TestSetBucket`, and `DiscoveryBucket`) so direct presigned-URL uploads/downloads succeed;
  - the custom origin (with and without trailing slash) is added to both Cognito App Client `CallbackURLs` and `LogoutURLs` (`ExternalAppClient` + the main `UserPoolClient`) so OAuth redirects — including federated Okta/SAML/OIDC sign-in via the Cognito Hosted UI — land back on the custom domain;
  - `VITE_CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN` is set to `""` at Web UI build time so `aws-exports.js` falls back to `window.location.origin` for `redirectSignIn` / `redirectSignOut`. The same build serves the ALB URL **and** the custom domain — Amplify always starts and finishes the OAuth flow on the same origin, removing the *"redirect is coming from a different origin"* error seen with custom DNS in front of ALB.
  
  Validated by `AllowedPattern` at template-parse time (lowercase-host `https://` URL, no path, no trailing slash). Default `""` resolves every conditional to `AWS::NoValue` so the rendered template is byte-identical to before for existing deployments — fully backward compatible. **Customer-side requirements** (outside the template): point the custom-domain DNS at the internal ALB, attach an ACM cert that covers the custom domain to the ALB listener (or use SNI), and — for federated IdPs — confirm Cognito's `oauth2/idpresponse` URL is registered as a redirect URI in the IdP. No Okta-side changes are needed for the custom domain itself; Okta only ever sees the Cognito `idpresponse` URL in this flow. See [`docs/alb-hosting.md`](docs/alb-hosting.md#custom-domain-in-front-of-alb).

- **AppSync DNS resolution documentation for cross-VPC/hybrid networks** — comprehensive guide in `docs/deployment-private-network.md` explaining why AppSync private APIs require DNS forwarding in central-network-account topologies, with step-by-step instructions for Route 53 Private Hosted Zone setup (same-account, cross-account, and hybrid/on-prem) and an alternative ALB reverse-proxy architecture for environments where DNS changes are not possible. New `AppSyncEndpointForDNS` stack output provides the hostname networking teams need for PHZ alias records.

- **CodeBuild VPC support** — All CodeBuild projects (WebUI build, unified Docker build, multi-doc-discovery Docker build, SDLC pipeline) now run inside the customer's VPC when `DeployInVPC=true`. Build traffic routes through the VPC, reaching public registries via NAT gateway or internal artifact repositories in air-gapped environments. This is a prerequisite for fully private deployments where builds must pull dependencies from internal registries. No changes when `DeployInVPC=false` (the default).

### Fixed

- **Test Studio results error for runs stuck in evaluation (#358)** — `getTestRun` (the `test_results_resolver` Lambda) raised an unhandled `ValueError` ("Test run … processing completed, evaluating results") when a run reached a terminal state but the evaluation-aggregation step never cached `testRunResult` — e.g. when aggregation is still running, timed out, or failed silently on a large run (the reporter hit this with 3 463 documents). The exception surfaced as an opaque error and the run spun on "Loading…" forever in Test Studio. The resolver now returns a structured partial `TestRun` (true status plus file counts and metadata, metric fields omitted) instead of raising, so the UI renders the in-progress/terminal state gracefully. This also stops a single not-yet-aggregated run from failing an entire `compareTestRuns` request. (The separate question of *why* aggregation can stall on very large runs is tracked as a follow-up.)
- **Configuration version list silently truncated past the first page (#354)** — `ConfigurationManager.list_config_versions()` performed a single unpaginated `table.scan()` on the ConfigurationTable. Because a DynamoDB scan returns at most 1 MB per call, deployments with many config versions (e.g. 230+) only ever saw the ~58 that fit on the first page — uploaded-via-CLI and autotune-agent configs were invisible in the UI's View/Edit Configuration page and the upload-document config-version dropdown (the configs still worked when referenced by name). The method now paginates through `LastEvaluatedKey` so every version is returned. Fixes all callers (`update_configuration`, the AppSync `configuration_resolver`, `rules_discovery`, and the SDK).

- **Build Info "update available" indicator broke against the public release bucket** — The `getLatestPublishedVersion` resolver discovered the newest published version by calling `ListObjectsV2` on the public artifacts bucket and parsing `idp-main_<version>.yaml` keys. That bucket grants `GetObject` only (no listing), so the check failed on real public deployments. `idp-cli publish` now writes a small pointer object — `<prefix>/idp-main-latest.json` (`{version, templateUrl}`) — at the version-stripped prefix on every release, and the resolver reads that one known key with a single `GetObject` (unsigned, falling back to signed), with a conventional `idp-main_<version>.yaml` URL fallback if the pointer omits one. No version parsing or `ListObjectsV2`. The check stays disabled when `PUBLIC_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET` is unset.

- **Private AppSync unreachable from browser clients (WorkSpaces, VPN, bastion)** — `scripts/vpc-endpoints.yaml` `VpcEndpointSecurityGroup` previously allowed inbound HTTPS (port 443) only from the Lambda security group. Browsers inside the VPC send AppSync GraphQL requests directly to the `appsync-api` VPC Interface Endpoint (not through the ALB), so all queries, mutations, and subscriptions hung indefinitely — the Configuration page showed "Loading configuration..." forever, the Document List never populated, and the Upload Documents page showed "Input bucket not configured". Fixed by adding a `VpcCidr` parameter and a second ingress rule for the VPC CIDR block. `deploy-vpc-endpoints.py` now auto-looks up the VPC primary CIDR via `ec2:DescribeVpcs` and passes it automatically — no CLI changes required. Re-run `deploy-vpc-endpoints.py` against an existing deployment to apply the fix.

### Changed

- ⚠️ **Behavioral change for air-gapped ALB deployments: browser S3 presigned uploads now default to global S3 instead of the S3 VPC Interface Endpoint.** Previously, selecting `WebUIHosting=ALB` automatically forced all presigner Lambdas to generate presigned URLs targeting the S3 VPCE hostname (`*.vpce-xxx.s3.<region>.vpce.amazonaws.com`), which required the browser's corporate network to resolve and route VPCE DNS — a configuration many customers can't or don't want to set up (uploads failed with `NS_Net_Timeout`). Presigned-URL routing is now decoupled from ALB hosting via a new `S3PresignedUrlViaVpcEndpoint` parameter (default `"false"`): presigned URLs use global `s3.amazonaws.com`, so browser uploads transit NAT/internet with no special DNS needed. **Migration:** existing `WebUIHosting=ALB` stacks that rely on VPCE presigned uploads (fully air-gapped browser networks with no NAT path) must set `S3PresignedUrlViaVpcEndpoint=true` on their next stack update, otherwise browser uploads switch to global S3. Stacks setting `S3VpcEndpointIdOverride` (BYO endpoint) are unaffected — they continue to use the VPCE. A CloudFormation `Rules` assertion rejects `S3PresignedUrlViaVpcEndpoint=true` unless an S3 VPCE is available (`WebUIHosting=ALB` or `S3VpcEndpointIdOverride` set).

## [0.5.14]

### Added

- **Dependency manifest generation for artifact-repository mirroring** — New `make dep-manifest` target (and `scripts/generate-dep-manifest.sh`) generates a complete, pinned list of all Python and Node.js dependencies for enterprises mirroring packages into an artifact repository (JFrog Artifactory, AWS CodeArtifact, Sonatype Nexus, etc.) for air-gapped, pre-scanned builds. Parses existing `uv.lock` and `package-lock.json` files (no re-resolution) plus any extra `requirements.txt`/`pyproject.toml` packages, writing pip-compatible (`name==version`) and npm-compatible (`name@version`) manifests to the gitignored `dist/manifests/`. A GitHub Actions workflow (`generate-dep-manifest.yml`) regenerates manifests on dependency-file changes (dry-run on PRs, 90-day artifact upload on `main`/manual dispatch). See the new [Dependency Mirroring](docs/dependency-mirroring.md) guide.

- **OpenAI GPT-5.4 / GPT-5.5 model support** — Added `openai.gpt-5.4` and `openai.gpt-5.5` everywhere Claude models are selectable (OCR, classification, extraction, assessment, summarization, evaluation, and Chat-with-Document). Unlike all other supported models, these are served via the **`bedrock-mantle` endpoint (OpenAI Responses API)** rather than the Converse API, so a new SigV4-signed HTTP backend was added in `idp_common/bedrock/openai_responses.py`. `BedrockClient.invoke_model` transparently routes `openai.gpt-5.*` IDs to it and returns the identical `{"response", "metering"}` contract, so no downstream service code changed. The Chat-with-Document processor routes GPT-5.x through a streaming Responses call (SSE), publishing incremental token deltas to the UI with the same throttling as the Converse path. Notes: these are reasoning models (temperature/top_p/top_k omitted) tuned via a new OpenAI-only `reasoning_effort` config field (`minimal`/`low`/`medium`/`high`, default `medium`) surfaced per service in the unified template and config models; **no prompt caching** (`<<CACHEPOINT>>` stripped); **incompatible with agentic/Strands extraction** — that combination is now a hard error in `idp-cli config-validate` and raises at runtime; **not supported for Discovery** (which ingests whole-PDF document blocks the Responses API can't accept) — rejected by config-validate and guarded at runtime; **standard service tier only**. Availability is **US regions only** — GPT-5.5 in `us-east-2`; GPT-5.4 in `us-east-2`, `us-west-2`, `us-gov-west-1` (no EU/global), so the models are hidden in EU-region deployments. Lambda roles gained `bedrock-mantle:CreateInference` (+ `Get*`/`List*`) IAM permissions. New env vars: `BEDROCK_MANTLE_REGION` (pin the mantle region), `BEDROCK_MANTLE_SIGNING_NAME`, `BEDROCK_MANTLE_REASONING_EFFORT`. Includes pricing and `model_config_limits` (128K max output) entries. See the new [OpenAI GPT-5.x Models](docs/openai-models.md) guide for the full support matrix and caveats.

- **Test Studio: Edit test set metadata** — Test sets can now be edited to update description (max 500 characters) and document classification type. Edit functionality available via new "Edit" button when a single test set is selected. Classification type metadata options: Unspecified, Single Class, Multi Class, Packet Splitting. Includes new `UpdateTestSetInput` GraphQL input type, `updateTestSet` mutation with `UpdateTestSetResolver` AppSync resolver, Lambda handler routing, and frontend Edit Test Set modal with form validation.

### Fixed

- **Agentic extraction no longer crashes merging token metering with `None` values** ([#337](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/337)) — `concurrent_structured_output_async` (used when a large document is split into concurrent extraction batches) raised `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'` when a Bedrock response reported a token counter as `None`. The existing `(tv or 0)` guard only covered the incoming value; the accumulated value (seeded verbatim from the first batch via `dict(mv)`) could itself be `None`, and `dict.get(tk, 0)` returns that stored `None` rather than the default for a present-but-`None` key. The metering merge is now factored into `_accumulate_metering`, which coerces `None` on both sides of the addition. This previously crashed otherwise-successful extractions in the post-processing step, marking the document FAILED.

- **Evaluation no longer fails on `None`/empty optional fields, empty arrays, or a single bad field** — Three related evaluation robustness fixes: (1) Optional fields with `None`/missing values (common in real schemas like URLA) no longer fail the confidence/assessment path with a misleading "Schema configuration error" — model fields are now widened to `Optional[...]` to work around upstream [stickler#149](https://github.com/awslabs/stickler/issues/149). (2) Auto-generated schemas with empty arrays (e.g. `[]` → bare `{"type": "array"}`) and objects that become empty after their unevaluable children are removed are now pruned instead of crashing the converter; genson's spurious `required` arrays are also stripped so a missing field scores as a miss rather than a hard error. (3) A single field that still fails validation is now dropped from scoring (and reported as a `__SKIPPED__` row with a coverage note) instead of zeroing out the entire section — limiting the blast radius so the remaining fields still evaluate.

- **Schema Builder: Standard Class catalog restored in "Add Class" modal** — The Document Schema *Add Class* modal again presents the two-card chooser (📝 Custom Class / 📦 Standard Class) for non-policy schemas, letting users import pre-built classes from the [Standard Class Catalog](docs/classification.md#standard-document-classes) (Invoice, Receipt, US driver's license, etc.). The chooser/standard-mode UI was inadvertently dropped from `SchemaBuilder.tsx` during the policy-discovery rewrite (commit `d701e6b88`); the underlying `StandardClassCatalog` component, `addStandardClasses` hook action, and `standard-classes.json` data file were all still present and needed only to be re-wired into the modal. Policy Schema "Add Policy Class" still skips the chooser and goes straight to the custom form (unchanged behavior).

- **Evaluation now handles null field descriptions** — Configs with `description: null` no longer cause evaluation failures. The evaluation service now automatically converts null descriptions to empty strings before JSON Schema validation (Stickler requirement). This fix ensures extraction results can be evaluated even when field descriptions are missing or null in config schemas. No functional impact on evaluation logic.

- **Updated the AppSync APIs** (1) all field-level `@aws_auth(cognito_groups:[…])` directives in `schema.graphql` replaced with `@aws_cognito_user_pools(cognito_groups:[…])`, which AppSync evaluates on multi-auth APIs; (2) server-side Cognito group checks added to every privileged resolver Lambda.

- **Navigation cleanup** — removed the "Resources" dropdown (Blog, Code) from the top-right user menu and added a "Blog" link to the top of the Resources section in the left navigation panel.

## [0.5.13]

### Added

- **Claude Opus 4.8 Model Support** — Added `anthropic.claude-opus-4-8` (and `:1m` context variant) across all `us`, `eu`, and `global` inference profiles. Includes unified template enums, UI model dropdowns, cachepoint support, EU region mappings, pricing entries, and documentation updates. Model is recognized as a Claude 4.7+ variant — the same temperature/top_p/top_k handling and 128K extended-output limit apply.

- **Amazon Quick + IDP MCP Integration Workshop** — step-by-step guide (`workshop/amazon-quick-integration-workshop.md`) that walks through deploying the IDP stack, configuring MCP connectivity in Amazon Quick, and building an end-to-end loan document processing workflow with structured data extraction and Excel output. Covers CloudFormation deployment, OAuth service-to-service auth setup, action configuration, and a multi-phase Amazon Quick workflow.
  
- **Stickler v0.4.0 upgrade with confidence calibration metrics** — upgraded evaluation engine from Stickler v0.1.4/v0.1.5 to v0.4.0, adding ECE (Expected Calibration Error), Brier score, ECARB@30, and AUROC metrics for confidence analysis. New `ConfidenceMetricsCalculator` in `idp_common.evaluation.confidence_integration` computes calibration metrics at overall and per-field levels. Test aggregation results now include `confidence_metrics` field with comprehensive calibration data. Confidence aggregation logic moved from frontend to backend (test execution aggregation function) for cleaner architecture. Evaluation service patches `field_comparisons` with `field_path` for ConfidenceCalculator compatibility and uses structural detection to unwrap wrapper keys (Item_N, Record_N) from extraction results. Fully backward compatible. Test Studio now displays Error Capture at Review Budget (30%) showing percentage of errors caught when reviewing lowest-confidence 30% of data. Format: "46% (1.52x)". New column in field metrics table (gear-icon configurable) and in Additional Metrics section.

- **Metric info tooltips** — All Test Studio metrics now include info icons with explanatory tooltips. Covers accuracy metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, Accuracy), confidence calibration metrics (AUROC, ECE, Brier, ECARB@30, Coverage Ratio), confusion matrix components (TP, FP, TN, FN), error rates (False Alarm Rate, False Discovery Rate), aggregate metrics (Avg Confidence, Avg Accuracy, Avg Weighted Score), and split classification metrics (Page Level Accuracy, Split Accuracy With/Without Order, Total Pages/Splits). Tooltips link to Wikipedia or Stickler documentation. Available in both TestResults and TestComparison views. Clicking info icons does not trigger table sorting.
  
### Changed

- **Default Chat-with-Document model promoted to `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8:1m`** — chat defaults now point at the newer Opus generation. EU deployments map automatically to `eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8:1m` via `UpdateConfiguration`. Existing custom configs are unaffected.

### Fixed

- **Agentic extraction now respects 128K output limit for Claude Opus 4.7+** — `_build_model_config` previously matched these models against the generic `claude-(opus|sonnet|haiku)-4` regex and silently capped them at 64K, contradicting the 128K declared in `model_config_limits.yaml`. A dedicated branch now returns 128K for opus-4-7 and opus-4-8.

- **`idp-cli deploy --headless` no longer leaves dangling references in the headless template** — the headless transformer now strips `HasPublicArtifactsBucket` (orphaned after `VersionCheckResolverFunction` was removed) and removes `ChatWithDocumentProcessorFunction` (only invoked by removed AppSync resolvers, with dangling `UsersTable` / `GraphQLApi` refs). `CircuitBreakerManagerFunction` is now also converted to DynamoDB tracking mode so its AppSync status-publish hook is stripped. Additionally, `--headless` (template transform) no longer auto-sets the `EnableHeadless` CFN parameter — that parameter opts into the Private API Gateway and requires VPC infrastructure, which is an orthogonal concern. Users who want the Jobs API must pass `--parameters EnableHeadless=true,VpcId=...` explicitly.

## [0.5.12]

### Added

- **Test Studio: Abort running test runs** — Test runs with status `QUEUED` or `RUNNING` can now be aborted from both the Web UI and CLI. The abort operation stops all pending document processing workflows, preserves results from already-completed documents, and updates the test run status to `ABORTED`. Metrics are automatically calculated for completed documents. The Web UI displays an "Abort" button next to running tests, and the CLI provides an `idp-cli abort-test-run` command with confirmation prompts. Aborted test runs show accurate completion counts (e.g., "48/50 files processed") and allow viewing partial results including evaluation metrics and cost breakdowns for successfully processed documents.

- **Optional `{CLASS_AND_ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}` placeholder for classification prompts** ([#262](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/262)) — Pattern 2 classification `task_prompt` templates can opt in to a new placeholder that expands, per document type, to the class name, description, **and** schema attribute names. Renders as XML for `multimodalPageLevelClassification` and as a markdown table for `textbasedHolisticClassification`. Cost-neutral by default — only materialized when the template references it, with per-class attribute counts capped (default 50) to keep prompt cost predictable. Useful for schema-rich domains where similarly-named classes have very different extraction schemas. The Web UI Prompt Preview tab renders the substituted attributes for inspection. See [`docs/classification.md`](docs/classification.md#optional-class_and_attribute_names_and_descriptions-placeholder).

- **Cross-account Bedrock invocation via STS AssumeRole** ([#305](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/305)) — IDP processing Lambdas can now route all Bedrock traffic through a centralized "hub" AWS account. Set the new optional `BedrockHubRoleArn` parameter (with optional external-id / session-name) and the stack conditionally adds `sts:AssumeRole` to each Lambda's execution role. STS credentials auto-refresh via `DeferredRefreshableCredentials` so warm Lambdas survive past the 1-hour STS session. Covers the entire pipeline plus discovery, embeddings, Chat with Document, and Agent Companion (incl. Strands sub-agents). Fully additive — leaving the parameter empty preserves prior same-account behavior. **Out of scope:** BDA runtime, Bedrock Knowledge Bases, and `model_finetuning/`. See [`docs/cross-account-bedrock.md`](docs/cross-account-bedrock.md).

- **Distinguish MISSING pages from BLANK fields in extraction output** ([#317](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/317)) — for sparsely-populated multi-section forms where pages may be legitimately omitted, extraction can now distinguish fields whose source page was *present but empty* (BLANK) from those whose source page was *not submitted* (MISSING). Two new optional schema extensions, `x-aws-idp-page-types` and `x-aws-idp-source-page-types`, declare named page sub-types and which page types each property sources from. A regex-based resolver detects present page types, annotates the LLM prompt with `--- PAGE N [PageType] ---` markers, and (when enabled) post-processes the JSON to drop/null fields whose source pages are absent. Output gains optional `page_type_resolution` and `missing_fields_report`. Fully additive; the Document Schema editor adds form widgets for both extensions. See [`docs/missing-page-handling.md`](docs/missing-page-handling.md) and the [demo notebook](notebooks/usecase-specific-examples/multi-page-bank-statement/step3_extraction_with_missing_pages.ipynb).

- **Private (VPC-only) deployment — browser uploads route through the S3 Interface VPC Endpoint** — when `WebUIHosting=ALB`, the ALB nested stack provisions an S3 Interface VPC Endpoint and exposes its regional DNS name as a new `S3VPCEndpointDnsName` output. Web UI presigner Lambdas, `ApiHandlerFunction`, and config/dataset custom resources receive an `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` env var and use virtual-host addressing so SigV4 matches the VPCE DNS. Browser uploads and Lambda S3 traffic stay on the AWS backbone with zero public-internet egress.

- **Bring-Your-Own S3 VPC endpoint** — two new top-level parameters (`S3VpcEndpointIdOverride`, `S3VpcEndpointDnsNameOverride`) let customers with a central network account reuse an existing endpoint instead of having the IDP stack provision one. Both must be set together; CloudFormation `Rules` enforce the pairing.

- **`monitoring` (CloudWatch) Interface VPC Endpoint** — `scripts/vpc-endpoints.yaml` now provisions a CloudWatch Interface VPC Endpoint, gated by the new `CreateMonitoringEndpoint` parameter (default `true`). Required for the `DashboardMerger` custom resource to succeed in private mode. `scripts/check-vpc-endpoints.sh` updated to detect and skip pre-existing endpoints.

- **`LambdaSecurityGroupId` parameter on the ALB nested stack** — when supplied, the ALB S3 VPC Endpoint security group allows inbound 443 from the app Lambda SG so VPC-resident Lambdas can reach S3 through the same endpoint as ALB. Fixes a 5-minute hang in `ConfigurationCopyFunction` caused by SG mismatch.


### Changed

- **ALB nested stack S3 VPC endpoint policy scoped to same-account operations** — the endpoint policy allows a finite set of S3 actions on `arn:${AWS::Partition}:s3:::*` conditioned on `aws:PrincipalAccount` / `aws:ResourceAccount` matching the deployment account. Wildcard resource is necessary to avoid cyclic dependencies on parent-stack buckets; authorization is additionally enforced at the network (SG) and IAM (role + bucket policy) layers. See `docs/deployment-private-network.md`.

- **`scripts/generate_self_signed_cert.sh` uses a short fixed CommonName (`idp-self-signed`) with the full ALB hostname in `subjectAltName`** — internal ALB DNS names often exceed the X.509 64-char CN limit, causing openssl to abort. Modern browsers validate only against SAN, so this is RFC-correct and removes the silent failure.

### Fixed

- **Agentic extraction now supports `:1m` model IDs (1M context window)** ([#312](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/312)) — agentic extraction with `:1m` model ids (e.g. `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-7:1m`) previously failed at ConverseStream with `ValidationException` because the agentic path forwarded the raw id to Strands' `BedrockModel`. `_build_model_config` now strips `:1m` and forwards the `anthropic_beta` header via Strands' `additional_request_fields`, matching the traditional Bedrock path. All `:1m` variants now work.

- **Bedrock Knowledge Base nested stack no longer left in `DELETE_FAILED` on update/delete** ([#315](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/315)) — two reliability fixes in `nested/bedrockkb/template.yaml`:
  - **Reliable `AWS::Bedrock::DataSource` deletion during sync** — the Delete handler now stops in-progress ingestion jobs and polls until terminal status (12-min deadline) before signalling SUCCESS, so CFN can delete the data source cleanly. Always reports SUCCESS on Delete (logs warnings) so a stuck job never blocks stack delete. IAM gains `Stop/Get/ListIngestionJobs`, timeout is 15 min, and ingestion functions `DependsOn` their schedulers to avoid races.
  - **Helper IAM roles now `DeletionPolicy: Retain`** — `DataSourceSchedulerRole` and `StartIngestionJobFunctionRole` are ephemeral helpers; marking them `Retain` decouples nested-stack delete from the deploying principal's `iam:DeleteRole` permission. Defensive fix for session policies that deny `iam:DeleteRole`. Retained roles are inert and can be deleted manually after the stack is gone.

## [0.5.11]

### Added

- **"Update available" indicator in Web UI Deployment Info** — the Deployment Info section of the side nav now shows a small `Update` badge next to the deployed `Version: …` line whenever a newer published template is available on the public artifacts bucket. Hovering the badge opens a popover showing the deployed and latest versions; for **Admin** users, the popover includes a one-click "Update stack in CloudFormation →" link that deep-links to the AWS console with the new template URL pre-filled (review parameters before applying). **Zero-touch by default**: `idp-cli publish` auto-substitutes the new `PublicArtifactsBucket` / `PublicArtifactsPrefix` CloudFormation parameter defaults to point at the bucket and prefix it's publishing to, so customers deploying the published template get the indicator out of the box. Headless / private-network deployments can override `PublicArtifactsBucket=""` to disable the check. The check itself runs in a small Lambda resolver (`getLatestPublishedVersion`) that lists the public bucket via unsigned S3 reads and caches results for 10 minutes. The headless template transformer (`HeadlessTemplateTransformer`) strips the resolver, parameters, and Settings entries so headless / GovCloud builds remain UI-free with zero dangling references.

- **Chat-with-Document enhancements** — the Web UI "Chat with Document" feature has been substantially upgraded:
  - **Async streaming** — responses now stream token-by-token into the chat bubble so large documents and long-context models no longer hit AppSync's 30-second synchronous timeout.
  - **Markdown rendering in assistant replies** — headings, bullet/numbered lists, fenced code blocks, inline code, tables, block quotes, and links render as formatted HTML instead of raw markdown characters. Renders during streaming and at final.
  - **Dedicated `chat` configuration section** — independent from `summarization`, with its own `model`, `system_prompt`, `temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p`, and `max_tokens`. Backward compatible: configs without a `chat` section fall back to `summarization.*`.
  - **UI model selector on the Chat panel** — per-session model override, populated from the config's model enum; default comes from the document's own config version.
  - **Default chat model is `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-7:1m`** — 1M-context by default so typical multi-hundred-page packets fit without hitting input-token limits. EU and GovCloud presets use their region-appropriate inference profiles.
  - **First-class support for Bedrock model-ID suffixes** — `:1m` (1M-context beta), `:priority` and `:flex` (service tiers) all work end-to-end when selected in the Chat panel dropdown.


### Changed

### Fixed

- **Config validation now checks max_tokens against model limits** — `idp-cli config-validate` now verifies that `max_tokens` is within the model's maximum output token limit, catching invalid configurations like `extraction.max_tokens: 16000` with `us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0` (max 10,000 tokens) before deployment. New `_validate_max_tokens()` function checks all services (extraction, classification, assessment, summarization) against model-specific limits loaded from `config_library/model_config_limits.yaml`: Claude 4.x (64,000), Claude 3.x (8,192), Amazon Nova (10,000), default (4,096). Added `get_model_max_output_tokens()` utility to `bedrock/model_utils.py` for use by CLI validation only (Lambda functions continue to use hardcoded limits for runtime defense-in-depth).

- **Empty content array handling across all LLM services** — LLMs occasionally return empty content arrays (`content: []`) instead of the expected text response, causing `IndexError: list index out of range` when accessing `content[0]`. All affected services now check for empty arrays before accessing elements and raise descriptive errors with task context. Applied to classification (page-level and holistic), summarization, bedrock client helper, and model finetuning inference. Added 11 unit tests in `test_empty_content_array.py` covering all edge cases (empty, single-element, multi-element arrays).

- **LLM array wrapping in extraction and assessment services** — LLMs occasionally return single-element arrays `[{...}]` instead of objects `{...}` when generating JSON responses, causing Pydantic validation errors (`Input should be a valid dictionary [type=dict_type, input_value=[{...}], input_type=list]`). All affected services now automatically detect and unwrap single-element arrays with a warning log, while multi-element arrays are rejected with a clear error message. Applied to standard extraction, agentic extraction, assessment service, and granular assessment service.

## [0.5.10]

### Added

- **Enhanced config validation** — `idp-cli config-validate` now validates Bedrock model IDs against `pricing.yaml` and checks that custom `task_prompts` include required placeholders (e.g. `{DOCUMENT_TEXT}`, `{DOCUMENT_IMAGE}`) across all pipeline sections. Runs automatically on `config-upload` (use `--no-validate` to skip).

- **`idp-cli discover --model-id` flag** — override the Bedrock model used by `idp-cli discover` for a single invocation (e.g. `--model-id us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1`). Applies to all discovery modes; backward-compatible. ([#309](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/309))

- **Bedrock circuit breaker** — a CFN-parameterized circuit breaker that pauses new workflow starts when Bedrock is unhealthy and auto-recovers once the service comes back, so transient Bedrock outages no longer burn through SQS retries or leave documents half-processed. Off by default for full backward compatibility.
  - New `circuit_breaker_manager` Lambda owns state transitions (`CLOSED` / `OPEN` / `HALF_OPEN`) in the existing `ConcurrencyTable`. Triggered by CloudWatch Alarms on Bedrock error metrics (via SNS) and by an EventBridge-scheduled health check that promotes `OPEN → HALF_OPEN` after `RECOVERY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. `workflow_tracker` closes the breaker after the first successful probe.
  - `queue_processor` gates new work before incrementing the concurrency counter; `OPEN` messages are redelivered by SQS (with `ChangeMessageVisibility` extended to the recovery timeout to avoid DLQ churn), DDB errors fail open.
  - All state transitions use conditional DDB writes so concurrent alarm/workflow updates cannot clobber each other. `failure_count` is preserved across `OPEN → HALF_OPEN`; manual reset zeros counters and clears `last_error`.
  - Operator hooks: manual `reset` / `get_state` invocations, optional customer Lambda invoked via `ERROR_HANDLER_ARN`, CloudWatch metrics (`CircuitBreaker{Opened,HalfOpen,Closed}`), and `AlertsTopic` notifications.
  - New CFN parameters (all default off): `EnableCircuitBreaker`, `CircuitBreakerRecoveryTimeoutSeconds`, `CircuitBreakerErrorHandlerArn`. Unit tests cover alarm/health-check/manual/race-loss branches.
  - **Web UI visibility & admin controls** — document list header shows a live status badge (green/blue/red with `lastError` tooltip) via an AppSync subscription; clicking opens a details panel. Admin-group users additionally get **Pause / Resume / Probe** buttons (each requires a reason, persisted and broadcast). All automatic transitions publish to the subscription so the badge updates within ~1s. Hidden entirely when `CircuitBreakerEnabled=false`. Backed by new AppSync ops (`getCircuitBreakerStatus`, `pause/resume/probeCircuitBreaker`, `onCircuitBreakerStatusChange`) and a new resolver Lambda that enforces Admin authorization at both the schema and resolver layers.
  - Docs: `docs/circuit-breaker.md` and `src/lambda/circuit_breaker_manager/README.md`.


### Changed

- **Replaced DSR with open-source SRT security scanning tool** — Migrated from the deprecated internal DSR tool to the open-source [Sample Security Review Tool (SRT)](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-security-review-tool). GitLab CI/CD now runs SRT on MRs targeting `develop` and fails the pipeline on findings. New Makefile targets: `make srt`, `make srt-setup`, `make srt-scan`, `make srt-fix`.


### Fixed

- **SRT now uses `--no-license-update`** to prevent it from automatically rewriting source file license headers during security scans.

- **Agentic extraction with Claude Opus 4.7 no longer fails with `top_p is deprecated`** — the Claude 4.7+ enablement in v0.5.7 fixed the traditional Bedrock path but missed the Strands-based agentic path (`idp_common/extraction/agentic_idp.py`), which still forwarded `top_p` to ConverseStream. Both paths now share the same `is_claude_4_7_model` detection and omit deprecated inference params. ([#304](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/304))

- **`idp-cli discover` silently ignored mismatched ground truth files** — previously a filename-stem mismatch between `-d` and `-g` only produced a warning and ran discovery without ground truth. Now: single-doc + single-GT invocations are paired by position (no filename match required); batch-mode mismatches or duplicate GT stems fail with exit `1` and a clear message. ([#310](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/310))

- **Web UI "View Source" failed for PDFs and other docs after the v0.5.9 CSP hardening** — three fixes in `FileViewer`: (1) pass an `s3://bucket/key` URI to `getFileContents` instead of relying on the build-time `VITE_AWS_REGION` env var; (2) render PDFs in an `<iframe>` instead of `<object>` so they're allowed under the hardened `object-src 'none'` CSP; (3) drop the `sandbox` attribute on the PDF iframe only (Chrome's built-in PDF viewer is blocked when sandboxed; non-PDF iframes keep their sandbox). Added a fallback "Open PDF in a new tab" link.

- **Private ALB deployment broken when stack name had uppercase characters** — the ALB DNS name is case-preserving, but browser `Origin` headers, Cognito `redirect_uri` matching, and the ALB url-rewrite regex all expected lowercase, so CORS preflights, OAuth callbacks, and the `/` → `/index.html` rewrite all failed. Fixed by lowercasing the ALB URL in every CFN consumer (new `GetLowercaseAlbUrl` custom resource reusing the existing `GetDomainLambda`), lowercasing the Amplify redirect URL in `aws-exports.js`, and broadening the ALB rewrite regex from `^/$` to `^/` so OAuth query strings don't break the match. CloudFront deployments unaffected. ([#303](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/303))

## [0.5.9]

### Added

- **Policy Discovery & Rule Validation Policy Classification**: Upload a regulatory document (e.g., an NCCI Medicare policy manual) and automatically extract structured validation rules from it. A new "Policy Discovery" tab in the Discovery page walks you through the process, and the extracted rules feed directly into the rule validation workflow.
  - A new policy classification step runs before rule validation, matching each document against your configured `policy_classes` using regex patterns on document names and page content. Only matching policy rules are evaluated, so unrelated rules are skipped automatically.
  - The configuration key `rule_classes` has been renamed to `policy_classes` for clarity. Existing configs will need to update this key.
  - The Schema Builder now has dedicated support for editing policy classes with policy-specific labels, and extraction-only settings are hidden when editing policy schemas.
  - A "Policy Discovery" section has been added to Discovery Configuration in the UI, letting you choose the model, temperature, and prompts used for Policy Discovery.
  - The legacy `rule-extraction` configuration preset has been removed. Use **Policy Discovery** on the Discovery tab instead — it writes extracted rules directly into the active config's `policy_classes`.

- **Document-level Download button on the Document Details page** — A new **Download** dropdown in the Document Details header lets users pull every output artifact for a document in a single click, packaged as a ZIP. Three scopes are offered:
  - **Download All (ZIP)** — document attributes, metering, summary, evaluation & rule-validation reports, per-section predictions, baselines (when available), per-page text/confidence, and optionally per-page images and/or the source document (checkboxes).
  - **Download Predictions (ZIP)** — all section result JSONs plus a self-describing `manifest.json`.
  - **Download Baselines (ZIP)** — all baseline section result JSONs (shown only when an evaluation baseline is available).
  - **Bucket-mirrored ZIP layout** — files are organised under top-level `output/`, `baseline/`, and `input/` folders that preserve the real S3 key structure, so the archive can be diffed with a direct `aws s3 sync` of the same buckets.


- **Headless REST API mode with VPC-secured deployment for GovCloud** — a first-party Jobs REST API for programmatic document submission and status tracking, plus an optional VPC-secured deployment that keeps the API off the public internet. Makes end-to-end GovCloud deployment viable without the UI/AppSync stack, and gives Commercial customers a supported alternative to direct S3 uploads for machine-to-machine integrations.
  - **Jobs REST API** (new `src/lambda/api_handler/`, `src/lambda/job_tracker/`, `src/lambda/batch_pre_processor/`):
    - `POST /jobs` — creates a job record and returns a presigned POST URL for the input zip (1-hour expiry, content-type pinned to `application/zip`, 5 GB content-length cap).
    - `GET /jobs/{job_id}` — returns overall status (`PENDING_UPLOAD` / `IN_PROGRESS` / `SUCCEEDED` / `PARTIALLY_SUCCEEDED` / `FAILED` / `ABORTED`), per-file status map, and — on success — a presigned GET URL for `results.zip`. `SUCCEEDED` is gated on `results.zip` actually being present in the output bucket to avoid racing callers into a 404.
    - OAuth2 `client_credentials` auth via a dedicated Cognito User Pool + Resource Server (`idp-api/jobs.read`, `idp-api/jobs.write` scopes). Separate from the existing web-UI Cognito pool.
    - **Per-client job ownership (M1):** each job records its creating Cognito principal (`sub` / `client_id`) as `CreatedBy`. `GET /jobs/{job_id}` returns **HTTP 404** (not 403, to avoid existence-leak) when the caller's principal doesn't match the job's owner. Legacy job records written before this field existed remain readable by any authenticated caller. **Behavior change:** `GET /jobs/{job_id}` on a non-existent job now correctly returns 404; previously returned 400 (a pre-existing response-code bug in the API handler).
  - **Private API Gateway + bastion tunneling:**
    - `AWS::Serverless::Api` with `EndpointConfiguration: PRIVATE` bound to a customer-supplied `ApiGatewayVpcEndpointId` and a resource policy that denies all traffic not originating from that VPC endpoint.
    - Optional `DeployBastionHost=true` spins up an SSM-reachable `t3.small` EC2 with IMDSv2 required, encrypted EBS via a dedicated rotating KMS key, and no inbound SSH. `scripts/bastion.sh <STACK_NAME>` sets up a local SSH tunnel for dev-time API access; `scripts/get_api_token.sh <STACK_NAME>` fetches an OAuth2 bearer token.
  - **Safe zip extraction in `batch_pre_processor` (M2 + M3):**
    - `MAX_UNCOMPRESSED_BYTES` (default 20 GiB, env-configurable) and `MAX_ENTRIES` (default 10,000) bounds checked **pre-flight** before any uploads begin. Bound violations write a terminal `FAILED` marker to the job record so the API surfaces the failure.
    - Per-entry streaming via `zipfile.ZipFile.open()` + `s3.upload_fileobj()` — no more loading whole entries into Lambda memory.
    - Per-entry failure isolation — one bad file is marked `FAILED` and the rest of the batch still uploads and advances through the pipeline; the job converges to `PARTIALLY_SUCCEEDED` / `FAILED` / `SUCCEEDED` as appropriate.
  - **New CFN parameters** (all default to off/empty, fully backward-compatible):
    - `EnableHeadless` (bool) — turns on the Jobs REST API.
    - `DeployInVPC` (bool) — places all IDP Lambdas in customer-supplied private subnets with a customer-supplied security group.
    - `VpcId`, `PrivateSubnetIds`, `ApiGatewayVpcEndpointId`, `LambdaSecurityGroupId`, `ApiStageName` — customer-supplied networking.
    - `DeployBastionHost`, `BastionHostSubnetId`, `BastionHostSecurityGroupId` — optional dev-access bastion.
    - **CloudFormation console UX** - the 11 new parameters are grouped into two dedicated `AWS::CloudFormation::Interface` sections ("Headless API Deployment (required for GovCloud)" and "Headless API Deployment - Bastion Host (optional, requires VPC Secured Mode)") with friendlier `ParameterLabels` and rewritten `Description` text. Each description now explicitly states when the parameter is required, what the default behavior is (no Jobs API / no Lambda VPC placement / no bastion EC2 unless explicitly enabled), and which companion parameters it depends on. Ensures Quick-Start users who click the README's "Launch Stack" button see clear opt-in sections rather than assuming the bastion host or Jobs API is always deployed.
  - **CFN fail-fast validation (H1)** — new `Rules:` block entries catch misconfiguration at stack create / update time with clear `AssertDescription` errors, instead of failing deep in resource provisioning:
    - `HeadlessRequiresVPC` — `EnableHeadless=true` requires `DeployInVPC=true` + non-empty `VpcId` / `ApiGatewayVpcEndpointId` / `LambdaSecurityGroupId`.
    - `BastionRequiresVPC` — `DeployBastionHost=true` requires `DeployInVPC=true` + non-empty bastion subnet / SG.
  - Plus **defense-in-depth** on the two API-gated Lambdas: `VpcConfig` is wrapped in `!If [DeployInVPC, …, AWS::NoValue]` so even if the Rules block is ever relaxed, the Lambdas won't fail to create on empty `!Ref` values.
  - **CLI (`idp-cli`):**
    - `--headless` now auto-sets the `EnableHeadless=true` stack parameter — they were always used together.
    - `idp-cli deploy --headless --from-code . --stack-name <NEW>` no longer requires `--admin-email`. The headless template strips the UI Cognito pool and has no `AdminEmail` parameter; passing it through produced `ValidationError: Parameters: [AdminEmail] do not exist in the template`. Now skipped and dropped with a note. Non-headless new-stack creation still requires `--admin-email`.
  - **Publish pipeline fixes that make headless-to-GovCloud deploys work:**
    - `cfn-lint` in headless mode now lints `idp-headless.yaml` and skips commercial-only templates (`idp-main.yaml`, `nested/appsync`), which contain `AWS::AppSync::*` / `AWS::CloudFront::*` resources that don't exist in `us-gov-*` regions. Fixes `E3006 Resource type … does not exist`.
    - E/W classification in `_validate_cfn_lint` now uses `^E\d{4}` / `^W\d{4}` regex anchors. Previously the substring `":E"` also matched resource prefixes like `AWS::EC2::`, inflating warning-severity lines to errors.
    - `WorkflowStateChangeRule` JobTracker target moved from a conditional `Arn` field (flagged `E3003 'Arn' is a required property`) to a conditional full-target dict via `!If`.
  - **Documentation:**
    - New `docs/govcloud-batch-api.md` — REST API reference with schemas, OAuth flow, bastion tunneling setup, and an Authorization model section covering per-client ownership and multi-client behavior.
    - New `docs/govcloud-architecture.md`, `docs/govcloud-operations.md`, `docs/vpc-secured-mode.md`.
    - Overhauled `docs/govcloud-deployment.md` with a deployment-variant matrix (Vanilla / Headless API / Headless + VPC / Headless + VPC + Bastion).
  - **End-to-end test script:** `scripts/e2e_test_headless.py <STACK_NAME> <PATH_TO_FILE>` exercises the full flow (OAuth → POST /jobs → presigned upload → status poll → download results).

- **Managed configuration upload rejection** — `idp-cli config upload` now rejects configuration files with `managed: true` to prevent users from accidentally creating stack-managed configurations that would be overwritten on stack updates. All user-uploaded configurations automatically have `managed: false` set, ensuring they persist across stack lifecycle events.

### Fixed

- **Evaluation markdown/report rendering resilience** — two defensive fixes that keep evaluation and test-results pages from crashing when upstream data is non-numeric or empty.

### Security

Hardening response to security review - Highlights:

- **Stored XSS defense-in-depth (frontend).** Introduced
  `SafeMarkdown` wrapper (`src/ui/src/components/common/SafeMarkdown.tsx`)
  that pairs `rehype-raw` with `rehype-sanitize` using an allow-list
  schema (retains `<details>`/`<summary>`, custom `<documentid>`,
  tables, code blocks, and a narrow `white-space: pre-line` style
  pattern; strips `<script>`, event handlers, `javascript:` URLs,
  `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`). Migrated all six legacy
  `ReactMarkdown + rehypeRaw` call sites across
  `MarkdownViewer.tsx`, `DocumentsQueryLayout.tsx`,
  `TextDisplay.tsx`, `AgentChatLayout.tsx`, and `AgentToolComponent.tsx`.
- **Stored XSS fix in Knowledge Base resolver (backend).**
  `query_knowledgebase_resolver` now HTML-escapes citation snippets,
  document titles, and URLs via `html.escape()` before embedding them
  in the rendered markdown.
- **Chat session ownership enforced.** `getChatMessages`
  (`get_agent_chat_messages_resolver`) now verifies that the calling
  Cognito user owns the requested `sessionId` by looking up
  `(userId, sessionId)` in `ChatSessionsTable`. Can be temporarily
  disabled via `ENFORCE_CHAT_SESSION_OWNERSHIP=false` env var for
  legacy-session migration. Fails closed on DynamoDB errors.
- **S3 URI allow-list in `getFileContents`.** The resolver now
  rejects any `s3Uri` whose bucket is not one of the IDP stack's
  configured buckets, preventing use as a generic S3-read gadget.
  Also fixes a latent bucket-name parsing bug and validates the
  URI scheme.
- **Log sanitization utility.** New
  `idp_common.utils.log_sanitizer.sanitize_event_for_logging()`
  deep-copies and redacts Cognito claims, identity blobs, auth
  tokens, and API keys from events before they are emitted to
  CloudWatch. Truncates common document-content fields to 500
  characters. Applied to `reprocess_document_resolver`,
  `query_knowledgebase_resolver`, and `get_agent_chat_messages_resolver`
  as reference integrations (rollout to remaining resolvers is tracked
  for a follow-up release). 15 unit tests added.
- **CSP hardening (Phase 1).** Tightened CloudFront
  `SecurityHeadersPolicy`: `object-src 'none'` (was
  `'self' blob: data: https:`), `connect-src` restricted to AWS
  service hostnames (was `https:`). `unsafe-eval` / `unsafe-inline`
  removal deferred pending Monaco-editor compatibility verification.
- **False-positive documentation.** Added explanatory comments and
  `nosec` justifications for:
  - Jinja2 autoescape disabled in `discovery_agent.py`
    (templates produce LLM prompts, not HTML).
  - Unsafe `yaml.load` findings in
    `scripts/sdlc/validate_service_role_permissions.py` and
    `lib/idp_sdk/idp_sdk/_core/publish.py` (both use
    `CFNLoader`/`CFLoader` subclassing `yaml.SafeLoader`; input is
    developer-committed CloudFormation templates, not user input).
  - SQL injection in `test_results_resolver` Athena queries (every
    interpolation is gated by `_validate_sql_input()` with a strict
    allow-list regex).

## [0.5.8]


### Added

- **Excluded-class feature — skip static instruction / legal / boilerplate pages** — Government forms and similar packages often bundle static informational pages (legal warnings, fee instructions, tax notices, oaths) alongside the pages that carry applicant data. Mark a document class with `x-aws-idp-exclude-from-processing: true` and all downstream stages (extraction, assessment, summarization, rule validation, evaluation) skip sections classified as that class — making **zero LLM calls** on boilerplate pages.
  - Optional `x-aws-idp-exclusion-reason` ("instructions", "legal", "cover-page", …) surfaces as a grey **`Skipped: <reason>`** badge in the UI Sections panel and as an **"Excluded Sections (Not Evaluated)"** table in the evaluation markdown report.
  - Configurable via the **UI Configuration Editor** → Document Schema → select a document-type class → "Exclude from Processing" checkbox + "Exclusion Reason" input.
  - New end-to-end sample config at `config_library/unified/ds11-passport-application/` with a matching DS-11 U.S. Passport Application PDF fixture and a standalone demo notebook (`notebooks/usecase-specific-examples/ds11-passport-application/`).
  - Additive: classes without the new flag behave exactly as before.
  - See `docs/classification.md#excluding-static-pages-eg-instructions-legal-boilerplate`.

### Changed

- **UI dependency cleanup — eliminated 11 of 12 npm deprecation warnings** — Replaced deprecated `@aws-sdk/*` packages with `@smithy/*` equivalents, removed unused Babel plugins, migrated ESLint 8→9 (flat config), upgraded Prettier 2→3, and upgraded jsdom 26→29. Added `"type": "module"` to `package.json`. Also added `caughtErrors: 'none'` to ESLint config to stop flagging unused catch clause variables. Added `FORCE=1` arg to `make ui-lint` to force re-run despite checksum match.

- **Headless deployment documentation generalized** — headless mode is no longer documented as a GovCloud-only capability. New `docs/headless-deployment.md` is the canonical guide covering headless deployment for both Commercial and GovCloud regions (API-only / pipeline integrations, organizational restrictions on UI-layer services, cost optimization, and required for GovCloud).

## [0.5.7]

### Added

- **Claude Opus 4.7 Model Support** — Added `anthropic.claude-opus-4-7` (and `:1m` context variant) across all `us`, `eu`, and `global` inference profiles. Includes unified template enums, UI model dropdowns, cachepoint support, EU region mappings, pricing entries, and documentation updates.

- **Add Documents to Existing Test Sets** — New "Add Documents" action in Test Studio allows incrementally adding documents (with ground truth) to an existing test set. Supports both "From Existing Files" (S3 pattern) and "From Upload" (ZIP) sources. Key features:
  - **Automatic baseline filtering**: When using the Input Bucket, files without matching baseline/ground truth data are automatically excluded rather than failing the operation, with a result message reporting counts (e.g., "Added 8 of 12 files (4 excluded - no baseline data)")
  - **Time filter**: Optional "Modified after" filter with presets (Last 1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days) and a custom date/time picker, available in both new test set creation and add-documents flows
  - **Idempotent**: Re-adding an existing document overwrites it; file counts are always recounted from S3 for accuracy
  - **UPDATING status**: Test sets show a transient "Updating..." badge while documents are being added

- **Creating Custom Test Sets Guide** — New tutorial-style documentation (`docs/creating-custom-test-sets.md`) walking through the end-to-end workflow for creating custom test sets with ground truth data from scratch: configure for max accuracy, discover document schema, process samples, review/edit predictions, save evaluation baselines, register test sets, and run comparative test executions to evaluate cost vs. accuracy tradeoffs. Referenced from `docs/demo-videos.md`.
  
- **Configuration Version Tracking Across All Analytics Tables** — Added `config_version` field to all analytics tables (metering, document_evaluations, section_evaluations, attribute_evaluations, and document_sections_*) to enable comprehensive tracking and analytics per configuration version. All Glue tables now include a `config_version` column, and all Parquet files store the configuration version used for each document. Enables direct filtering and comparison queries without complex JOINs - users can query "show me W2 documents processed with config v2.1" or "compare accuracy for configs v2.0 vs v2.1" with simple WHERE clauses. Supports cost analysis, A/B testing, quality comparison, and data lineage tracking. Documents without a config version default to "default".

### Fixed

- **Incorrect global inference profile IDs for Knowledge Base model** — Fixed `global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-v1:0` and `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-v1:0` in the `KnowledgeBaseModelId` CloudFormation parameter dropdown. These shortened IDs were invalid and caused `ResourceNotFoundException` when used. Corrected to `global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0` and `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0` per the [AWS Bedrock inference profiles documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-profiles-support.html). ([#286](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/286))

- **Application Inference Profile IAM permissions** — Added `application-inference-profile/*` ARN pattern to `bedrock:InvokeModel` IAM policies across all templates (root, appsync, multi-doc-discovery, and sample templates). PR #236 previously fixed only `patterns/unified/template.yaml`; this completes the fix for all Lambda execution roles. Also added `bedrock:GetInferenceProfile` read permission to support prompt caching resolution. ([#272](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/272))

- **Prompt caching with application inference profiles** — Fixed `<<CACHEPOINT>>` tags being stripped when using Bedrock application inference profile ARNs as model IDs. The cachepoint check now resolves inference profile ARNs to their underlying foundation model via the `GetInferenceProfile` API, enabling prompt caching for profiles that wrap supported models (Claude, Nova). Results are cached to avoid repeated API calls, with graceful fallback if the API call fails. ([#272](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/272))

- **Chat with document uses hardcoded US model ID** — Fixed "Chat with document" feature failing in non-US regions (e.g., `eu-west-1`) with "The provided model identifier is invalid" error. The backend Lambda's `get_summarization_model()` fallback was hardcoded to `us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0`. Added `get_default_model_for_region()` helper that selects the appropriate region-prefixed model (`eu.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0` for EU, `us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0` for US) based on `AWS_REGION`. ([#282](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/282))

- **BDA activation modal checking wrong version config** — Fixed the "Activate Version" flow incorrectly checking the *currently selected* version's `use_bda` flag (`mergedConfig?.use_bda`) instead of the *target* version being activated. This caused the BDA sync confirmation modal to appear (or not appear) based on the wrong version's configuration. The fix fetches and inspects the target version's actual config before deciding whether to show the modal. Also added a `fetchVersions()` refresh after BDA sync operations to keep BDA project ARN metadata up to date in the versions list.

## [0.5.6]

### Added

- **Test Studio CLI Commands** — `idp-cli test-result` to retrieve test results with automatic evaluation triggering and `--wait`/`--output-dir` options, and `idp-cli test-compare` to compare multiple test runs with JSON/CSV export. See `docs/idp-cli.md`.

- **Custom Model Fine-Tuning** — Fine-tune Amazon Nova 2 models (Lite and Pro) for document classification and extraction using your own labeled Test Sets. The end-to-end workflow — validate data, generate training data, train via Bedrock, and deploy an on-demand custom model endpoint — is driven from a new **Custom Models** page in the Web UI. Custom models can then be selected in any configuration version for classification and/or extraction. Available to Admin and Author roles. **Note:** currently requires deployment in `us-east-1`. See `docs/custom-model-finetuning.md`.
  
- **External SAML/OIDC Identity Provider Federation** — Optional support for federating authentication through an external SAML or OIDC identity provider via Amazon Cognito. Enables organizations to use existing enterprise identity providers (PingOne, Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, etc.) for single sign-on. All federation functionality is opt-in through 12 new CloudFormation parameters — leaving them empty results in zero additional resources and identical behavior to existing Cognito-native authentication. See `docs/external-idp.md`.

- **Private Network Deployment** — Deploy the IDP Accelerator in fully private / air-gapped environments. New `AppSyncVisibility` parameter (`GLOBAL` | `PRIVATE`) makes the AppSync API accessible only from inside the VPC. All processing Lambda functions (21 across 3 templates) are conditionally placed in customer VPC subnets with an HTTPS-only security group. Includes a separate VPC endpoint CloudFormation template (`scripts/vpc-endpoints.yaml`) with 16 interface endpoints (AppSync, Bedrock, SQS, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, SSM, KMS, STS, Textract, and more) and per-endpoint creation flags to skip pre-existing endpoints. All features are off by default — existing deployments are completely unaffected. See `docs/deployment-private-network.md`.

- **Enhanced Information Panels** — Added comprehensive help content to the Information (ⓘ) panel on every page in the Web UI. Each panel now includes a feature summary, list of key capabilities, and "Learn more" links to relevant docs-site documentation pages. Created new panels for 8 pages that previously had none (Pricing, Capacity Planning, Custom Models, Discovery, User Management, Test Studio), and enriched the existing 7 panels with fuller descriptions and documentation links.
  
### Changed

- **Removed Claude Sonnet 4:1m and Sonnet 4.5:1m model variants** — The 1M context window beta for Claude Sonnet 4 (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0:1m`) and Sonnet 4.5 (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0:1m`) is being retired effective April 30, 2026. These `:1m` model variants have been removed from all enum lists, UI dropdowns, quota code mappings, pricing, and documentation. Users needing 1M context windows should migrate to Claude Sonnet 4.6 (`claude-sonnet-4-6:1m`), where the 1M context window is generally available (GA).

- **Default extraction model updated** to `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6` (was `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0`) in system defaults.
- **Error Analyzer system prompt improvements** — Added strategy for large batches, priority ordering, and error classification guidance.
- **Error Analyzer settings** — Replaced duplicate inline cache with the shared cache from the common monitoring package.
- **Shared CloudWatch Logs** — Extracted log search logic from the Error Analyzer into a reusable library in the common monitoring package.
- **Enhanced CI/CD Automated Testing** — Enhanced GitLab CI/CD pipeline smoke tests with parallel test execution (8 tests running concurrently with fail-fast behavior), deeper verification (extraction fields, classification results, rule statistics), and added new tests: multi-document concurrent processing (Test 4), Test Studio evaluation with metrics validation (Test 7), agentic extraction with large table validation - 532 fund items (Test 8), single-document discovery (Test 9), and multi-document discovery (Test 10).

### Fixed

- **Fixed** agentic extraction crash (`TypeError: unsupported format string passed to NoneType.__format__`) when table parsing stats contain `None` values for `avg_confidence` or `parse_success_rate`.
- **Fixed** agentic extraction `map_table_to_schema` producing phantom empty rows from non-matching tables (e.g. account_summary rows prepended to transaction_details), causing list item ordering to be shifted by several positions.
- **Error Analyzer model selection** — The agent was using the Chat Companion's model instead of its own configured model.
- **Error Analyzer log processing** — Fixed early termination that stopped searching after the first Lambda function with errors; now searches all relevant log groups.
- **Error Analyzer log truncation** — Fixed handling of long log messages to trim them rather than skip them entirely.
- **Reprocess from Document Details** — Fixed config version not being passed when reprocessing a document from the Document Details page (showed "N/A" instead of the selected version).
- **Analytics Agent date awareness** — Injected current UTC date/time into the analytics agent system prompt so the LLM can correctly handle relative-time queries (e.g., "show me today's documents", "what was processed this week").

## [0.5.5]

### Added

- **Multi-Document Discovery** — New capability to automatically discover document classes from a collection of documents. Instead of manually defining document schemas one at a time, users point to a folder of mixed documents and the system automatically identifies document types, clusters similar documents, generates JSON Schemas with field definitions for each type, and saves them to a configuration version — ready for immediate use in the processing pipeline. Available from the Web UI, CLI (`idp-cli discover-multidoc`), and SDK (`client.discovery.run_multi_doc()`).
  - **Web UI**: New "Multi-Document" tab on the Discovery page with job submission form (config version selector, bucket selector, S3 prefix input, zip upload), jobs table with search/filter/sort/pagination, and detailed job results page with pipeline progress, expandable JSON schemas, config deep-links, and Quality Review Report
  - **CLI**: `idp-cli discover-multidoc --dir ./samples/ -o ./schemas/` with Rich progress bars, results table, and reflection report
  - **SDK**: `client.discovery.run_multi_doc(document_dir="./samples/")` with typed `MultiDocDiscoveryResult` response model
  - **Two Input Modes**: S3 path (select bucket + prefix), zip upload (presigned URL), or local directory (CLI/SDK)
  - **Configuration Integration**: Discovered classes are saved directly to the selected config version's `classes` array in DynamoDB, immediately available for document processing without manual schema creation

- **Prompt Preview** — New "Prompt Preview" tab in the Configuration page lets you preview the actual prompts sent to the LLM for each processing step (Classification, Extraction, Assessment, Summarization). Config-derived placeholders are filled in with real values (class names, cleaned JSON Schema), while document-specific placeholders are shown as highlighted markers. Includes token estimates, copy-to-clipboard, and a substitution details panel showing the exact schema sent to the LLM. Helps optimize document class schemas and prompt templates.

- **IDP CLI `chat` Command & SDK `ChatOperation`** — Interactive Agent Companion Chat from the terminal and programmatic SDK access. Runs the same multi-agent orchestrator as the Web UI locally, with real-time streaming and multi-turn conversation support. Includes Analytics Agent, Error Analyzer Agent, and optionally Code Intelligence Agent (`--enable-code-intelligence`). Available as `idp-cli chat --stack-name <stack>` for interactive use, `--prompt` flag for single-shot scripting, and `client.chat.send_message()` in the Python SDK. See `docs/idp-cli.md#chat`.

- **Per-Class Extraction Model Override** — New JSON Schema extension allows overriding the global `extraction.model` on a per-document-class basis. Useful when certain document types benefit from a different model (e.g., a more powerful model for complex financial forms, a faster/cheaper model for simple documents). Classes without the extension continue to use the global default. Works with both traditional and agentic extraction modes. See `docs/extraction.md` — Per-Class Extraction Model Override section.

- **Chandra OCR Lambda Hook Sample** — New `GENAIIDP-chandra-ocr-hook` sample in `samples/lambda-hook-inference/` that integrates [Datalab Chandra OCR 2](https://github.com/datalab-to/chandra) with the LambdaHook feature for high-quality OCR. Supports 90+ languages, math, tables, forms, and handwriting. Uses the Datalab hosted async API (`/api/v1/convert`) with configurable output format (markdown/json/html) and conversion mode (fast/balanced/accurate). Includes standalone SAM template, local test script, and deployment instructions. See `docs/lambda-hook-inference.md` — Chandra OCR Integration section.

- **Average Cost Per Page Metric** — Test results and test comparison views now display an "Avg Cost/Page" metric, calculated from total cost and page counts in the cost breakdown. Also included in CSV and JSON exports from the comparison view.

- **Wildcard pattern support for delete-documents** — `idp-cli delete-documents` and `client.batch.delete_documents()` now accept a `--pattern` / `pattern` parameter for fnmatch-style wildcard matching (e.g. `"batch-123/*.pdf"`, `"*invoice*"`). Combines with `--status-filter` to delete e.g. all failed invoices across batches.

- **Agentic Extraction Hardening** — Improved robustness, observability, and table parsing for agentic extraction:
  - Pre-flight OCR & schema analysis with adaptive guidance strength (RECOMMENDED → STRONGLY_RECOMMENDED → MANDATORY) ensures table parsing tool is used for large tables
  - Deterministic Markdown table parser with lookahead recovery, auto-merge of split tables, and configurable `max_empty_line_gap`
  - Post-extraction completeness validation against schema constraints with detailed shortfall reporting
  - Processing report with tool usage decisions, completeness checks, and root cause diagnostics (new UI tab + CloudWatch logs)
  - Thread-safe state management via `contextvars.ContextVar`; deprecated review agent (config fields preserved as no-ops)
  - Bug fixes: `patch_buffer_data` slice correction, confidence assessment loop fix, row-based parse success metric, NoneType guard in completeness check

### Fixed

- **Headless deployment fails with `ConfigurationPreset` AllowedValues error and `GraphQLApi.Arn` reference error** — Added `lending-package-sample-govcloud` to the base template AllowedValues and ConfigurationMap, and auto-detect GovCloud region (`us-gov-*`) for headless template transform instead of missing or hardcoded flag. Also added Discovery resources (BlueprintOptimization, MultiDocDiscovery, DiscoveryProcessor, etc.) to headless removal list to fix `GraphQLApi.Arn` unresolved reference error.

- **`delete-documents` fails with DynamoDB errors** — Fixed two bugs in `get_documents_by_batch()`: (1) passing empty `ExpressionAttributeNames={}` when no status filter caused `ValidationException`, and (2) using low-level DynamoDB client type descriptors (`{"S": "..."}`) with the high-level Table resource caused `begins_with` operand type mismatch. Rewrote to use the high-level `Table.scan()` API with `boto3.dynamodb.conditions.Attr`.

## [0.5.4]

### Added

- **MLflow Experiment Tracking Integration** — Optional integration with Amazon SageMaker MLflow for automated test run logging. When enabled (`EnableMLflow=true`), every Test Studio run automatically logs metrics (accuracy, cost, field-level scores), configuration parameters (model IDs, temperatures, inference settings), and artifacts (full config snapshots, class definitions, cost breakdowns) to an MLflow tracking server. Fire-and-forget async invocation — never blocks or delays test results. Zero resources created when disabled. See `docs/mlflow-integration.md`.

- **BDA Blueprint Optimization** — Automatically improves BDA extraction accuracy using the `InvokeBlueprintOptimizationAsync` API. When discovery includes a ground truth file and `enable_blueprint_optimization: true` is set, the system optimizes the BDA blueprint by comparing extraction results against ground truth, evaluates before/after metrics, and updates the blueprint schema if improved. Disabled by default. See `docs/discovery.md` — Blueprint Optimization section.

- **idp_common API Reference & Documentation** — Added `docs/idpcommon-api-reference.md` covering all 22 modules, created 6 missing module READMEs (discovery, schema, image, s3, utils, metrics), updated core data model docs to match current code, fixed `IDPConfig` lazy-loading bug in `__init__.py`, and integrated into docs-site sidebar.

- **Consolidated publish and headless deploy into `idp-cli`** — All build/publish/deploy functionality now available through the CLI, deprecating standalone scripts:
  - `publish.py` and `publish.sh` are deprecated — use `idp-cli publish` instead. `publish.py` remains as a thin backward-compatibility wrapper. `publish.sh` has been removed.
  - `scripts/generate_govcloud_template.py` is deprecated — use `idp-cli publish --headless` or `idp-cli deploy --headless` instead. The script remains as a thin wrapper.
  - New `--template-file` option on `idp-cli deploy` for deploying from a local CloudFormation template file produced by a previous `idp-cli publish`.
  - `idp-cli deploy --headless` (without `--from-code`) now downloads the published template, transforms to headless with GovCloud config defaults, uploads to S3, and deploys — all in one command.

### Fixed

- **HITL review start overwrites document sections** — Fixed the Start Review action to update only the Review Status and Review Owner fields, preserving all existing document sections and other fields.

- **Evaluation schema error for free-form objects** — Stickler mapper now detects and skips unevaluable object schemas (e.g., objects with `additionalProperties` but no defined `properties`, and arrays of such objects) instead of raising validation errors.

- **Full document reprocess not re-running OCR** — Fixed bug where clicking "Reprocess" in the UI reused stale OCR results from the previous run instead of re-executing OCR with the current configuration. The reprocess resolver now deletes previous output data from S3 before queuing, preventing the OCR function's retry-safe recovery from reinstalling old results.

- **Agentic extraction timeout on long documents** — Fixed repeated Lambda timeouts when agentic extraction exceeds the 15-minute limit on large documents (e.g., 25-page brokerage statements with 600+ holdings). Added incremental S3 checkpointing that saves extraction state after each tool call — covers both the extraction tools path (`extraction_tool`, `apply_json_patches`, `make_buffer_data_final_extraction`) and the buffer tools path (`patch_buffer_data`) that the agent uses for very large batched extractions. The checkpoint format tracks which state was saved (`current_extraction` vs `intermediate_extraction` buffer) so the correct resume path is used. On Step Function retry, the Lambda loads the checkpoint and the agent resumes from where it left off rather than restarting from scratch. No CloudFormation or Step Function changes required — the existing `Sandbox.Timedout` retry mechanism now makes incremental progress. Only active when agentic extraction is enabled; standard extraction is unaffected.

- **Agentic extraction fails on Bedrock InternalServerException without retrying** — Fixed `InternalServerException` errors (transient Bedrock server-side errors) causing immediate Lambda failure after only botocore's fast 7 retries, bypassing the application-level retry decorator (50 retries with 5s→1800s exponential backoff). Root cause: `InternalServerException` and `InternalServerError` were missing from all three retry layers — the `async_exponential_backoff_retry` decorator's `DEFAULT_RETRYABLE_ERRORS` set (`bedrock_utils.py`), the `BedrockClient._invoke_with_retry()` retryable errors list (`bedrock/client.py`), and the Step Functions ExtractionStep Retry `ErrorEquals` list (`workflow.asl.json`). All three layers now include these transient errors, providing proper exponential backoff retry at the application level and Lambda-level retry via Step Functions as a safety net.

## [0.5.3]

### Added

- **Discovery UX Enhancements** — Major improvements to the Discovery experience:
  - **Multi-Section Package Discovery** — New "Multi-Section Package" discovery mode with PDF page thumbnail preview, color-coded page ranges, and parallel job creation. Users define page ranges to discover multiple classes from a single PDF. Each range creates an independent discovery job.
  - **✨ AI Auto-Detect Sections** — "Auto-detect sections" button uses a configurable LLM prompt (`discovery.auto_split`) to automatically identify document boundaries and pre-fill page ranges with document type labels.
  - **Discovery Mode Selector** — Tile-based mode choice between "Single Section Document" (with optional ground truth) and "Multi-Section Package" (with page ranges). Ground truth and page ranges are mutually exclusive.
  - **Class Name Hints** — Document type labels (from auto-detect or manual entry) are passed as class name hints to guide the discovery LLM's `$id` and `x-aws-idp-document-type` output.
  - **Real-time Job Monitoring** — Live progress messages, elapsed time counters, phased upload status ("Creating jobs..." → "Uploading..." → "Refreshing..."), discovered class name badges, and expandable error details with user-friendly messages.
  - **Jobs Table UX** — Search/filter, time range selector, pagination, resizable columns, column preferences, multi-select delete, config version hyperlinks, and page range badges on multi-section jobs.
  - **S3 Upload Race Condition Fix** — Replaced hardcoded `time.sleep(30)` with smart S3 polling using exponential backoff (2s–10s, 60s timeout).
  - **New GraphQL APIs** — `autoDetectSections` mutation, `pageRanges`/`pageLabels` on `uploadDiscoveryDocument`, `pageRange`/`discoveredClassName`/`statusMessage` on job types, `deleteDiscoveryJob` mutation.

- **Discovery CLI & SDK Enhancements** — New capabilities in `idp-cli discover` and `client.discovery` that bring parity with the Web UI's Discovery features:
  - **Class Name Hints** — `--class-hint` (CLI) / `class_name_hint=` (SDK) to pre-label discovered classes, guiding the LLM's `$id` output.
  - **Multi-Section Page Ranges** — `--page-range "1-3" --page-label "W2 Form"` (CLI, repeatable) / `discovery.run_multi_section(page_ranges=[...])` (SDK) to discover multiple document classes from a single multi-page PDF.
  - **AI Auto-Detect Sections** — `--auto-detect` / `--detect-only` (CLI) / `discovery.auto_detect_sections()` (SDK) to automatically identify document section boundaries using LLM analysis, then optionally discover each section.
  - **BDA Sync Command** — New `idp-cli config-sync-bda` command and `client.config.sync_bda()` SDK method for explicit bidirectional synchronization between IDP configuration classes and BDA blueprints. Supports `--direction` (bidirectional, bda-to-idp, idp-to-bda) and `--mode` (replace, merge).
  - **New Models** — `AutoDetectResult`, `AutoDetectSection`, `ConfigSyncBdaResult`, `page_range` field on `DiscoveryResult`.

- **IDP SDK & CLI Overhaul** — Major refactoring of the SDK and CLI for a cleaner, more maintainable architecture:
  - **`IDPClient` entry point** — Single public interface with typed namespace access (`client.batch`, `client.stack`, `client.config`, `client.manifest`, `client.testing`). CLI commands now route through `IDPClient` instead of importing internal modules, ensuring consistent behavior across CLI, Web UI, and programmatic access.
  - **Typed return models** — SDK operations return Pydantic models instead of raw dictionaries, enabling IDE auto-complete and type checking.
  - **Enhanced config validation** — Manifest and config validation reports deprecated/unknown fields; config upload detects whether a version exists and handles creation vs. update correctly.
  - **Enhanced stack operations** — Deploy and delete commands support in-progress detection, live monitoring, cancel-update, and failure analysis.
  - **Private API boundaries** — Internal modules renamed from `core/` to `_core/` with lint rules enforcing the boundary.

- **IDP MCP Connector** — Local package that bridges coding assistants like Cline and Kiro to the IDP MCP Server with automatic Cognito authentication and dynamic tool discovery.

- **ALB+S3 VPC Hosting Mode** — Alternative web UI hosting using Application Load Balancer with S3 VPC Interface Endpoint for environments that require VPC-based hosting (private networks, regulated environments, corporate networks without internet-facing CDN access). ([#245](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/pull/245))
  - New `WebUIHosting` parameter (`CloudFront` | `ALB`) with conditional resource creation — CloudFront and ALB resources are mutually exclusive
  - ALB hosting nested stack (`nested/alb-hosting/template.yaml`) with ALB, S3 Interface VPC Endpoint, security groups, custom resource Lambdas for VPC CIDR lookup and target registration
  - TLS 1.3 enforcement, access logging, scoped VPC endpoint policy (`s3:GetObject`/`s3:ListBucket` only), and multi-CIDR security group ingress management
  - Self-signed certificate generation script (`scripts/generate_self_signed_cert.sh`) for demo/testing
  - New documentation: `docs/alb-hosting.md` — prerequisites, deployment steps, security considerations, troubleshooting, CloudFront vs ALB comparison

- **`make help` target** — Added `make help` with categorized, auto-generated descriptions for all 33 Makefile targets; updated CONTRIBUTING.md to match.

- **Test Studio Field-Level Metrics** — Test results now display per-field extraction performance in an interactive table showing Field Name, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, TP, FP, TN, FN. Metrics are searchable, sortable, and paginated in an expandable section. Enables identification of low-performing fields and tracking improvements after configuration changes.

- **Stickler Bulk Aggregation for Test Studio** — Test Studio now uses Stickler's `BulkStructuredModelEvaluator` with `aggregate_from_comparisons()` for accurate metric aggregation across multiple documents. Each document is evaluated with `include_confusion_matrix=True`, results are stored in S3, and aggregated when viewing test results. Eliminates Athena queries for new data, improving accuracy, consistency, and cost-effectiveness.

- **RBAC Security Hardening** — Comprehensive audit and hardening of GraphQL API authorization against the documented RBAC permission matrix:
  - **Query-level `@aws_auth` directives** — Added server-side role enforcement to 20+ GraphQL queries that were previously open to all authenticated users. Configuration, pricing, capacity, discovery, test studio, config library, and agent query system queries now enforce role restrictions at the AppSync schema level (e.g., Reviewer cannot access configuration, discovery, test studio, or pricing queries).
  - **Admin-only enforcement for "Save as Version" / "Save as Default"** — The `updateConfiguration` resolver now checks caller role and rejects non-Admin users attempting `saveAsVersion` or `saveAsDefault` operations, which were previously only blocked in the UI.
  - **Server-side RBAC filtering in `listDocumentsByDateRange`** — Added reviewer-only document filtering and config-version scope filtering to the date range resolver, matching the existing `listDocuments` GSI resolver pattern. Updated CloudFormation template with `USERS_TABLE_NAME` environment variable and DynamoDB IAM permissions.
  - **Updated RBAC documentation** (`docs/rbac.md`) — Complete mutation and query authorization tables, AppSync `@aws_auth` + `@aws_iam` limitation documented, all previously missing API entries added.

- **Threat Model Documentation** — Comprehensive threat model for the GenAI IDP Accelerator covering architecture overview, STRIDE analysis, feature-specific threats (agent analysis, companion chat, knowledge base, Lambda hooks, MCP integration, RBAC, reporting, SDK/CLI, web UI), risk assessment matrix, AI-generated threat analysis, implementation guide, and Threat Composer JSON export.

- **Managed Configuration Versions** — Pre-deployed test sets now have dedicated stack-managed config versions (`managed: true`) that are automatically created and overwritten on stack updates. Save and delete are disabled for managed versions in the UI and API. Test Studio auto-selects the matching config version when a test set is selected, replacing the hardcoded mapping.

- **Removed older Claude models** from Configuration UI picklists (3.x, 4.0, 4.1). Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.5, and Opus 4.6 are available for selection in the UI. Existing configurations using older versions still work.

### Changed

- **SDK & CLI: Renamed processing commands for clarity** — Old names are deprecated (emit `DeprecationWarning`) but remain available for backward compatibility:
  - `client.batch.run()` → `client.batch.process()`
  - `client.batch.rerun()` → `client.batch.reprocess()` (same for `client.document.rerun()` → `.reprocess()`)
  - `idp-cli run-inference` → `idp-cli process`
  - `idp-cli rerun-inference` → `idp-cli reprocess`
- **SDK: `stack.delete()` now waits by default** — The `wait` parameter defaults to `True` (previously fire-and-forget). Pass `wait=False` to restore the old behavior.
- **MCP: Renamed `docs/mcp-integration.md` to `docs/mcp-server.md`** for clarity.
- **MCP: Renamed Lambda function `agentcore_analytics_processor` to `agentcore_mcp_handler`** to better reflect its role as the MCP protocol handler (not just analytics).
  - CloudFormation resource `AgentCoreAnalyticsLambdaFunction` → `AgentCoreMCPHandlerFunction`
  - CloudFormation resource `AgentCoreAnalyticsLambdaLogGroup` → `AgentCoreMCPHandlerLogGroup`
  - Lambda FunctionName: `${StackName}-agentcore-analytics` → `${StackName}-agentcore-mcp-handler`
  - Source directory: `src/lambda/agentcore_analytics_processor/` → `src/lambda/agentcore_mcp_handler/`

- **Page images broken for document IDs containing parentheses** — Fixed issue where document page thumbnails and Visual Document Editor images failed to load (showing "Image load error") when the document ID contained parentheses (e.g., `lending_package(1).pdf`). Root cause: JavaScript's `encodeURIComponent()` does not encode `(`, `)`, `!`, `'`, `*` but AWS S3 SigV4 requires them to be percent-encoded in the canonical URI, causing signature mismatches. Added S3-safe URI encoding in `generate-s3-presigned-url.ts`.
- **"View Rule Validation Summary" button not appearing in real-time** — Fixed two-part bug: (1) State machine `ResultPath` for rule validation steps wrote to `$.RuleValidationOrchestrationResult` instead of `$.Result`, so downstream steps lost the `rule_validation_result`. (2) `RuleValidationResultUri` was missing from `UPDATE_DOCUMENT` and `GET_DOCUMENT` GraphQL selection sets in `mutations.py`, so AppSync subscriptions never delivered the field to the UI. Button appeared only after page refresh.
- **Page images broken for document IDs containing parentheses** — Fixed issue where document page thumbnails and Visual Document Editor images failed to load (showing "Image load error") when the document ID contained parentheses (e.g., `lending_package(1).pdf`). Root cause: JavaScript's `encodeURIComponent()` does not encode `(`, `)`, `!`, `'`, `*` but AWS S3 SigV4 requires them to be percent-encoded in the canonical URI, causing signature mismatches. Added S3-safe URI encoding in `generate-s3-presigned-url.ts`.
- **"View Rule Validation Summary" button not appearing in real-time** — Fixed two-part bug: (1) State machine `ResultPath` for rule validation steps wrote to `$.RuleValidationOrchestrationResult` instead of `$.Result`, so downstream steps lost the `rule_validation_result`. (2) `RuleValidationResultUri` was missing from `UPDATE_DOCUMENT` and `GET_DOCUMENT` GraphQL selection sets in `mutations.py`, so AppSync subscriptions never delivered the field to the UI. Button appeared only after page refresh.
- **Fillable PDF form fields missing from rendered page images** — Fixed bug where fillable PDF form fields (text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns) were not rendered in page images, causing OCR and extraction to miss user-entered data. Two-part fix: (1) `PdfDocument.init_forms()` initializes the form rendering engine so PDFium can process form fields, and (2) `page.flatten()` merges form field appearances into page content before rendering — required because many fillable PDFs (especially government forms) lack pre-generated appearance streams. Applied in both Pattern 2 (`OcrService`) and Pattern 1 (`create_pdf_page_images`) PDF rendering pipelines. ([#240](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/240))
- **CLI monitoring exits prematurely before documents start processing** — Fixed bug where `idp-cli process --monitor` would exit immediately after uploading documents, showing 0% completion even though documents were still queued. Root cause: The monitoring loop checked `all_complete` which returned `True` when no documents had completed or failed yet (0 == 0). Added 60-second grace period before allowing early exit, ensuring monitoring waits for documents to be picked up by the queue and start processing.
- **Discovery subscription handler dropping errorMessage and other fields** — Fixed bug where the UI subscription handler did `{ ...oldJob, status: updatedJob.status }`, discarding all fields except status from real-time subscription updates. Error messages, discovered class names, and status messages were being sent by the backend but silently dropped by the UI. Now spreads all fields: `{ ...oldJob, ...updatedJob }`.
- **Discovery processor S3 race condition causing NoSuchKey failures** — The discovery upload resolver sends the SQS message before the browser finishes uploading the file to S3 via presigned POST. Previously worked around with a hardcoded `time.sleep(30)`. Replaced with `_wait_for_s3_object()` that polls S3 with exponential backoff (2s initial, 10s max, 60s timeout), proceeding as soon as the file appears.
- **CLI `--parameters` parsing for comma-delimited values** — Fixed `idp-cli deploy --parameters` to handle values containing commas (e.g., `ALBSubnetIds=subnet-a,subnet-b`). Previously the naive `split(",")` broke multi-value parameters. ([#245](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/pull/245))
- **GovCloud template: fix unresolved RBAC resource dependencies** — Added `AuthorGroup`, `ViewerGroup`, `GetMyProfileResolver`, and `UpdateUserResolver` to GovCloud removal lists so they are stripped alongside the `UserPool` they depend on.
- **Document status and sections not updating in real-time during processing** — Fixed regression from RBAC commit where `updateDocumentStatus` subscription events (used during Map state steps: Extraction, Assessment, Rule Validation) were silently discarded because they lacked `InitialEventTime`/`QueuedTime` fields, causing `isDocumentInActiveRange` to reject them. Also fixed: stale sections/pages not clearing immediately on full reprocess, sections appearing duplicated or out of order during parallel Map execution (null-protection merge + client-side sort by page ID).
- **Fix race condition in `idp-cli generate-manifest --test-set`** — Added `.uploading` marker file protocol to prevent the test set resolver from prematurely validating test sets while the CLI is still uploading baseline files ([#193](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/193)).
- **Test Fixes** — Updated CLI test mocks to align with the new `IDPClient`-based implementation, fixing broken test fixtures that referenced removed internal imports.

## [0.5.2]

### Added

- **Multi-tenancy with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** — 4-role model (Admin, Author, Reviewer, Viewer) with server-side AppSync auth directives, server-side Reviewer document filtering, and UI adaptation. Admin has full access; Author can edit config and process documents but cannot manage users or delete config versions; Viewer has read-only access (editors, save buttons, and edit mode all disabled); Reviewer sees only HITL-pending documents. Non-admin roles can be scoped to specific use cases via `allowedConfigVersions`. See `docs/rbac.md`.

- **Standard Class Catalog** — When adding a new document class in the Schema Builder, users can now choose between **Custom Class** (define from scratch) and **Standard Class** (import from a catalog of 35 pre-built document types). Standard classes are derived from AWS BDA standard blueprints and include common document types like Invoice, Receipt, W-2, Bank Statement, Payslip, US Driver License, US Passport, various tax forms (1040, 941, 940, W-9, 1098, 1099), insurance cards, birth/death/marriage certificates, and more. Each standard class comes with a complete extraction schema including attributes, descriptions, and nested types. Imported classes are fully editable. Run `make classes-from-bda` to refresh the catalog from the BDA API.

- **Documentation Site** — Added a hosted documentation site built with [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), auto-deployed to GitHub Pages. Provides full-text search (Pagefind), sidebar navigation organized by topic, dark/light mode, and a professional landing page — all sourced directly from the existing `docs/` markdown files with zero content duplication. Browse at [aws-solutions-library-samples.github.io/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws](https://aws-solutions-library-samples.github.io/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/).

- **Discovery accessible from CLI and SDK** — Discovery can now be run programmatically via the IDP SDK (`client.discovery.run()`) and CLI (`idp-cli discover`), enabling users with many document classes to automate schema generation without the Web UI. Supports both modes: without ground truth (exploratory) and with ground truth (optimized). ([#228](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/228))

- **Custom Model Fine-tuning** — Improve extraction and classification accuracy for your specific document types by fine-tuning Amazon Nova models on your own labeled data — no ML expertise required. Select a Test Set with ground truth, choose a base model, and the system handles training data generation, Bedrock fine-tuning, and on-demand model deployment automatically. Custom models are billed pay-per-token with no idle costs. Available to Admin and Author roles. See [Custom Model Fine-tuning](./docs/custom-model-finetuning.md) for details.
  - **Web UI**: New "Custom Models" page with job creation form (test set selector, base model selector, train/validation split), jobs table with status tracking, and detailed job view with deployment status and configuration version creation
  - **CLI / SDK**: `idp-cli finetuning create`, `idp-cli finetuning status`, `idp-cli finetuning list`, `idp-cli finetuning delete` commands for programmatic job management
  - **GraphQL API**: New `createFinetuningJob`, `getFinetuningJob`, `listFinetuningJobs`, `deleteFinetuningJob` mutations/queries with `FinetuningJob` type and real-time status fields
  - **Step Functions Workflow**: 7-Lambda orchestration pipeline — list documents, parallel document processing (Distributed Map), merge training data, create Bedrock fine-tuning job, poll job status, deploy custom model via Provisioned Throughput
  - **CloudFormation Resources**: `FinetuningDataBucket` (S3), `FinetuningStateMachine` (Step Functions), 7 Lambda functions with IAM roles, CloudWatch log groups, and Bedrock permissions for model customization and deployment
  - **Shared Training Data Utilities**: Common module (`idp_common.model_finetuning.training_data_utils`) for extraction field parsing, baseline formatting, PDF-to-image conversion, and document image handling — shared across Lambda functions to eliminate code duplication

### Changed

- **Python 3.12+ now required** — Updated minimum Python version from 3.10 to 3.12 to address security vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies.

- **Sync to BDA no longer auto-activates the config version** — Previously, performing "Sync to BDA" would automatically set the current config version as active. Since each config version now has its own BDA project, auto-activation is unnecessary. Users can manually choose which version to activate via the Versions table. The "Sync to BDA" confirmation modal text has been updated accordingly.

- **Removed `Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) Project ARN` CloudFormation parameter** — The deploy-time `Pattern1BDAProjectArn` parameter has been removed as it was redundant with the per-config-version BDA project management already available in the Web UI, CLI, and GraphQL API. BDA projects are now managed entirely post-deployment: enable `use_bda: true` in your configuration, then use "Sync to BDA" to create or link a BDA project, or "Sync from BDA" to import from any existing BDA project. This simplifies the deployment experience (one fewer parameter) and better aligns the CloudFormation interface with the system's actual architecture. Existing deployed stacks are unaffected — runtime BDA project ARN resolution reads from DynamoDB per-version tracking, not from the CloudFormation parameter. Also removed the unused `nested/bda-lending-project/` directory (dead code not referenced by any template) and the legacy `BDA_PROJECT_ARN` environment variable fallback from the sync resolver.

### Fixed

- **CLI: Remove deprecated `--pattern` references** — Updated `idp-cli.md` and CLI code to reflect the unified pattern architecture. Removed `--pattern` from all deploy and config command examples/options.

- **Discovery no longer injects default config classes into target version** — Previously, running Discovery on a configuration version would merge all classes from the `default` version into the target version alongside the newly discovered class. Now Discovery only adds/updates the discovered class within the target version's own class list, keeping the version's classes exactly as the user curated them.

- **Documentation: Comprehensive review and cleanup** — Fixed outdated references, broken links, and missing content across documentation files.

- **Inference Profile pricing ARN truncation in UI** — Fixed pricing display and cost breakdown truncation for Bedrock Application Inference Profile ARNs containing multiple `/` characters (e.g., `bedrock/arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:123456789012:application-inference-profile/088k6ehrxpci`). The UI was splitting on all `/` separators instead of preserving the full ARN, causing the profile ID to be dropped in the Pricing page display, Test Studio cost breakdowns, and CSV exports. Backend pricing lookup was not affected. ([#237](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/237))

## [0.5.1]

### Added

- **Scalable Document List and Test Executions** — Comprehensive redesign to eliminate UI and backend bottlenecks when working with thousands of documents. ([#203](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/203))
  - **TypeDateIndex GSI on TrackingTable**: New DynamoDB Global Secondary Index (`ItemType` + `InitialEventTime`) enables efficient queries by item type (document, testrun, testset) sorted by time, replacing full table scans. Includes 20 projected attributes for list-view rendering without base table fetches.
  - **GSI Attribute Backfill Mechanism**: Robust Step Functions state machine with parallel scan workers that automatically backfills `ItemType` and `HITLPendingReview` attributes on existing items during stack upgrades. Features timeout-safe continuation, idempotent conditional updates, and automatic trigger via CloudFormation Custom Resource.
  - **GSI-Based Document List Resolver**: New `listDocuments` Lambda resolver queries the TypeDateIndex GSI with server-side pagination (`limit`/`nextToken`).
  - **`getDocumentCount` API**: New efficient count query using GSI `Select: 'COUNT'` for accurate document totals without fetching data.
  - **UI Document List Rewrite**: Eliminated the N+1 query pattern (shard queries → individual `getDocument` per document). Now uses a single paginated `listDocuments` GSI query for all time periods. First page renders immediately with incremental background loading of remaining pages.
  - **Subscription Optimization**: `onUpdateDocument` events now use subscription data directly instead of triggering individual `getDocument` API calls, eliminating thousands of redundant requests during active processing.
  - **GSI-Based Test Runs Query**: Replaced full table scan in `get_test_runs()` and `get_test_runs_by_date_range()` with GSI query + BatchGetItem pattern for efficient test run listing with all fields (including Context, ConfigVersion).
  - **GSI-Based Test Sets Query**: Replaced full table scan in `get_test_sets()` with GSI query + BatchGetItem pattern, avoiding scanning the entire TrackingTable (which includes all documents) just to find ~10 test sets.
  - **`ItemType` Written on All Creation Paths**: All document, test run, and test set creation paths (DynamoDB service, AppSync resolvers, test runners, dataset deployers) now write `ItemType` and `InitialEventTime` for immediate GSI indexing.
  - **Improved Error Messages**: Document list errors now show the actual failure reason (e.g., Lambda throttling, timeout details) instead of generic "please try again" messages.

- **GraphQL Type Generation & Unit Testing** — Replaced 60+ hand-written GraphQL query/mutation/subscription files with auto-generated types via `@graphql-codegen`, added typed AWSJSON parsers with unit tests (vitest + jsdom), and integrated a CI codegen-check to prevent type drift.

- **Third-Party Model Support** — Added Meta Llama 4 Maverick 17B, Llama 4 Scout 17B, Google Gemma 3 27B IT, and NVIDIA Nemotron Nano 12B v2 VL as selectable models across all pipeline stages (OCR, Classification, Extraction, Assessment, Summarization, Evaluation, Discovery, Agents, Rule Validation). Includes per-token pricing configuration and EU region fallback mappings for Llama 4 models. ([#217](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/217))

- **Load Test Config Version Support** — Added `--config-version` parameter to the `idp-cli load-test` command, enabling load tests to target a specific configuration version. Files uploaded during load tests now include `config-version` S3 metadata, consistent with the `process` command behavior.

- **Deploy Failure Root Cause Analysis** — Enhanced `idp-cli deploy` failure reporting to recursively analyze nested stack events and identify actual root causes. Previously, failures in nested stacks showed only a generic "Embedded stack was not successfully created" message. Now displays a structured "Root Cause Analysis" section with the specific resource, type, and error message from the nested stack that caused the failure, along with cascade failure counts.

- **MCP Server** — Added additional tool to MCP Server for retrieving results of the processed document from the IDP system.


### Changed


- **OCR Benchmark Config Optimization** — Optimized `config_library/unified/ocr-benchmark` configuration with targeted field descriptions, explicit model/prompt/OCR settings, and corrected date format (YYYY-MM-DD to match ground truth). Improved overall extraction accuracy from 51.5% to 75.2% on the full 293-document benchmark at equivalent cost (~$2.62). Classification remains 100% across all 9 document classes. ([#220](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/pull/220))

- **GraphQL Type Generation & Unit Testing** — Replaced 60+ hand-written GraphQL query/mutation/subscription files with auto-generated types via `@graphql-codegen`, added typed AWSJSON parsers with unit tests (vitest + jsdom), and integrated a CI codegen-check to prevent type drift.

### Fixed

- **AgentCore Gateway Manager** — Fixed the issue where gateway was not getting deleted once stack is deleted.

- **Configuration Page Error Display** — Fixed `[object Object]` error message when configuration loading fails (e.g., due to Lambda throttling) by properly extracting error messages from Amplify GraphQL error responses.

- **OCR Retry Logic** — Fixed broken retry chain between OCR Lambda and Step Functions that caused document processing failures under Textract throttling. The OCR Lambda was catching `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` and re-raising it as a generic `Exception`, which Step Functions didn't match for retries. Now propagates a `ThrottlingException` that Step Functions can retry on. Also added retry-safe page skipping so retries only re-process failed pages instead of re-OCRing the entire document, and increased OCR step retry attempts from 2 to 6 with longer backoff intervals. ([#195](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/195))

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- **Unified Pattern** — Merged Pattern-1 (BDA) and Pattern-2 (Pipeline) into a single deployment. Switch between BDA and Pipeline processing modes at runtime using the `use_bda` configuration toggle — no redeployment needed. Use [Test Studio](./docs/test-studio.md) to compare accuracy and cost across both modes to find the optimal approach for your documents. See the [Migration Guide](./docs/migration-v04-to-v05.md) for upgrade instructions.

- **Rule Validation for BDA mode** — Rule validation (business rule checking) is now available in both BDA and Pipeline modes. Previously it was Pipeline-only.

- **Fake W-2 Tax Form Test Set Auto-Deployment** — New pre-deployed benchmark test set with 2,000 synthetically generated US W-2 tax form images and structured ground truth, sourced from HuggingFace (`singhsays/fake-w2-us-tax-form-dataset`, originally from Kaggle under CC0: Public Domain license). Features 45 ground truth fields per document covering employer info (EIN, name, address), employee info (SSN, name, address), federal wages/taxes (boxes 1-8), compensation codes (boxes 12a-d), checkboxes (box 13), and state/local taxes (boxes 15-20). Includes both clean and noisy image variants for testing OCR robustness. Ideal for benchmarking W-2 extraction accuracy, evaluating image quality impact on processing, and testing structured form data extraction at scale.

- **AWS Profile Support for CLI** — Added optional `--profile` parameter to specify AWS credentials profile. Can be placed anywhere in the command. Automatically applies to all AWS SDK calls.

- **Enhanced `status` CLI/MCP Command with Advanced Search, Filtering, and Analytics** — Added PK substring search (`--batch-id` now matches partial batch identifiers across multiple batches), `--object-status` filter for searching by processing status (COMPLETED, FAILED, etc.), `--get-time` flag for timing statistics (processing, queue, total time with min/max outlier tracking), `--include-metering` flag for Lambda GB-seconds usage and cost estimates, and `--show-details` flag for detailed document information. Introduces `TrackingTableSearcher` class for flexible DynamoDB tracking table queries. Fully backward compatible with existing usage.

- **Added Replace/Merge sync modes for BDA synchronization** — Both "Sync from BDA" and "Sync to BDA" now support two modes: **Replace** (default) aligns the target to match the source exactly, removing items not in the source; **Merge** adds source items to the target without removing existing items. The UI modal now always shows a mode selection and ARN input (pre-filled for linked projects).


### Deprecated

- **Pattern-1 (BDA) and Pattern-2 (Pipeline) separate deployments** — Replaced by the Unified Pattern. Existing stacks are automatically upgraded. See the [Migration Guide](./docs/migration-v04-to-v05.md) for details.

- **Pattern-3 (UDOP + Bedrock)** — Pattern-3 is no longer available as a deployment option. If you are currently using Pattern-3 with a SageMaker UDOP endpoint, do not upgrade to v0.5.x without first testing in a non-production environment. You can use the [Lambda Inference Hooks](./docs/lambda-hook-inference.md) feature (introduced in v0.4.15) to call your existing SageMaker UDOP endpoint from the unified pattern's classification step via a custom Lambda function.

### Changed


- **Switched `idp_sdk` pyproject.toml to auto-discovery** — Replaced explicit subpackage listing with `setuptools.packages.find` using `include = ["idp_sdk*"]` so new subpackages are automatically included without manual pyproject.toml updates.

- **Resilient Test Set Deployment — Graceful Degradation on Download Failures** — All test set deployer Lambdas (RealKIE-FCC, OmniAI-OCR-Benchmark, DocSplit-Poly-Seq) now handle download failures gracefully instead of causing CloudFormation stack rollbacks. When a dataset source (HuggingFace) is unreachable or a download fails, the deployer creates a FAILED test set record in DynamoDB with a descriptive error message visible in the Test Studio UI, and sends `cfnresponse.SUCCESS` to CloudFormation so the stack deployment continues. Previously failed deployments are automatically retried on the next stack update. This ensures transient third-party service outages never block IDP infrastructure deployment.

- **Replaced PyMuPDF (AGPL-3.0) with pypdfium2 (Apache-2.0/BSD-3-Clause) for PDF rendering** — Resolves license incompatibility with the project's MIT-0 license. pypdfium2 provides equivalent PDF-to-image rendering using PDFium engine. Page rendering is now performed sequentially before parallel OCR processing to ensure thread-safety.

### Fixed

- **Fixed "Sync from BDA" not removing IDP classes absent from BDA project** — Previously, "Sync from BDA" only added new classes from the BDA project without removing classes that weren't in BDA. Now defaults to "Replace" mode which fully aligns the config version's classes with the BDA project, removing classes not present in BDA. A new "Merge" mode is also available to preserve the legacy additive behavior.

- **Fixed insufficient Lambda memory for Extraction, Assessment, and Evaluation functions in unified pattern template** — Increased MemorySize from 512 MB (Extraction, Assessment) and 1024 MB (Evaluation) to 4096 MB to match all other document processing Lambda functions, preventing potential out-of-memory errors during document processing. ([#205](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/205))

- **Fixed DOCX processing to extract text from embedded images and correct page splitting** — DOCX files with embedded images (e.g., `<w:drawing>` elements) now have image content OCR'd and included in the extracted text instead of being silently skipped. Page splitting now uses DOCX metadata (explicit page breaks, image display dimensions from `wp:extent`, section properties) instead of inaccurate height estimates, producing correct page boundaries.

  - Comprehensive capacity planning tool to optimize document processing performance, predict resource requirements, and calculate AWS service quota needs
  - **Pattern 2 Exclusive**: Only available for Pattern 2 deployments
  - **Token Usage Configuration**: Define expected tokens per document type for each processing step (OCR, Classification, Extraction, Assessment, Summarization)
  - **Auto-Populate from Documents**: Extract token usage and page counts from actual processed documents' metering data with time range filtering (2hrs to 30 days or custom date range)
  - **Processing Schedule**: Configure hourly document volumes with template-based auto-fill options (single slot, all doc types at 9 AM, business hours, full day)
  - **Quota Calculation**: Automated AWS Bedrock quota requirements (TPM and RPM) with 10% safety buffer

  - **Documentation**: New [capacity-planning.md](docs/capacity-planning.md) with comprehensive feature guide, calculation formulas, and safety buffer explanations
- **React UI TypeScript Migration (Phases 1–3 — Complete)** — Completed full migration of the React UI codebase from JSX/JS to TSX/TS. Phases 1–2 added TypeScript tooling and migrated contexts, hooks, constants, and utilities. Phase 3 migrated all remaining 207 components, GraphQL operations, routes, modals, and entry points across 13 incremental sub-phases (211 files changed). Removed `prop-types` dependency; all runtime prop validation replaced with TypeScript interfaces. No behavioral or visual changes. ([#187](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/187), [#188](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/pull/188), [#191](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/pull/191), [#198](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/pull/198))
- **Configuration Version Management Commands for CLI and SDK** — Added `config-list`, `config-activate`, and `config-delete` CLI commands and corresponding `client.config.list()`, `client.config.activate()`, `client.config.delete()` SDK operations for programmatic configuration version management. Includes safety protections (default/active version deletion prevention, confirmation prompts, existence validation), `--force` flag for automation, and Rich table output for version listing.
- **Added support for Claude Opus 4.6 model and Long Context (1M) variant**
- **Added support for Claude Sonnet 4.6 model and Long Context (1M) variant**
- **Included MCP tools `process`, `reprocess`, `status`, `search` for document processing**
- **Added `process` and `reprocess` CLI commands for batch operations via command line**
- **Added external mcp client example `examples/external-mcp-client`**
- **Maintained `run-inference` and `rerun-inference` CLI commands with deprecation notices**

### Fixed

- **Fixed DynamoDB 400KB item size limit blocking configs with 45+ document classes** — Configuration data is now gzip-compressed before storing to DynamoDB, achieving 37-95x compression ratios. Supports 3,000+ document classes within the 400KB limit. Fully backward compatible with existing deployments. ([#200](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/200), [#201](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/pull/201))
- **Fixed Processing Flow chart using active stack config instead of the document's actual config version** for determining disabled steps (assessment, summarization, etc.)
- **Fixed `idp_sdk` pip install from GitHub missing subpackages** — Non-editable pip installs of `idp_sdk` from GitHub were missing `core/`, `models/`, and `operations/` subpackages, causing `ModuleNotFoundError`. Fixed by explicitly declaring all subpackages in `pyproject.toml`. ([#196](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/196))

## [0.4.15]

### Added

- **Lambda Hook Inference (Custom LLM Integration)**
  - Customers can provide their own custom Lambda function to integrate with any LLM — models hosted on SageMaker, ECS, EC2, or external APIs — by selecting `LambdaHook` as the model in any pipeline step
  - **Per-Step Granularity**: Configure LambdaHook independently for OCR, Classification, Extraction, Assessment, and Summarization (Pattern-2)
  - **Converse API-Compatible Contract**: Lambda receives the same Converse API payload structure used with Bedrock, and returns a Converse API-compatible response — documented request/response format for easy implementation
  - **S3 Image References**: Inline image bytes automatically uploaded to S3 and replaced with `s3Location` references to avoid Lambda's 6MB payload limit
  - **GENAIIDP- Naming Convention**: Lambda function names must start with `GENAIIDP-` for secure, scoped IAM permissions
  - **Built-in Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter for transient errors (throttling, timeouts), matching Bedrock retry behavior
  - **Metering Integration**: Token usage from Lambda response tracked in document metering data for cost calculations
  - **Sample Functions**: Examples in `samples/lambda-hook-inference/` — Bedrock proxy (with customization points) and SageMaker endpoint hook, with SAM template
  - **Documentation**: New [lambda-hook-inference.md](docs/lambda-hook-inference.md) with architecture diagram, configuration guide, payload contract, SageMaker example, IAM, and limitations

- **Configuration Versioning System**
  - Manage multiple named configuration versions as complete, self-contained snapshots
  - **Version Management UI**: Configuration Versions table with create, compare, activate, delete, and import operations; version comparison with CSV/JSON export
  - **Full Config Storage**: Each version stores the complete configuration; editing and saving a version persists the full config, making behavior predictable and debuggable
  - **Active Version**: One version is marked active for new document processing; selectable when uploading documents, running tests, or reprocessing
  - **Version Tracking**: Config version recorded per document (S3 metadata + DynamoDB) and displayed across Document List, Document Details, Test Studio results, and all exports
  - **Unsaved Changes Protection**: Per-field unsaved change indicators (orange dots), info banner with "Discard changes" button, and browser navigation guards (`beforeunload` + SPA hash navigation)
  - **CLI Integration**: `--config-version` parameter for `run-inference`, `config-download`, and `config-upload` commands with version validation before processing
  - **Test Studio Integration**: Version selector in Test Runner, version tracking per test run, version displayed in Test Results and Test Comparison views
  - **Legacy Support**: Existing sparse-delta configs auto-detected and seamlessly migrated to full format on first read
  - **Stack Upgrade Independence**: Stack upgrades update only the `default` version; user versions are locked snapshots that users explicitly manage
  - **Documentation**: New [configuration-versions.md](docs/configuration-versions.md) with comprehensive feature documentation
  - **~200 lines of merge/delta/sync code removed**: Eliminated runtime merge logic, auto-sync on default updates, null-as-deletion semantics, and auto-cleanup of matching defaults

- **Custom Date Range Selector for Document List and Test Executions** - [GitHub Issue #177](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/177)
  - Added "Custom range..." option to the time period dropdown in both Document List and Test Studio → Test Results
  - Users can now select absolute start/end dates to query historical documents beyond the previous 30-day limit
  - **Scalable Server-Side Architecture**: Custom date ranges use a new `listDocumentsByDateRange` Lambda resolver that iterates shards server-side and batch-fetches documents, avoiding the client-side fan-out scalability issue
  - **Existing Behavior Preserved**: Relative period presets (2h through 30d) continue using the proven client-side shard mechanism — zero changes to existing code paths
  - **365-Day Maximum**: Date range capped at 365 days in the UI to prevent unbounded queries

### Fixed

- **Schema Builder Few-Shot Examples Input Focus Loss** - [GitHub Issue #174](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/174)
  - Fixed cursor jumping out of input fields after each keystroke when editing few-shot examples in the Schema Builder


- **Code Intelligence Agent - DeepWiki MCP Transport Migration**
  - Fixed "client initialization failed" error when using Code Intelligence Agent in Agent Companion Chat
  - **Root Cause**: DeepWiki deprecated their SSE transport endpoint (`/sse`) and now returns HTTP 410 Gone
  - **Solution**: Migrated from SSE (`sse_client`) to Streamable HTTP (`streamablehttp_client`) transport using the new `/mcp` endpoint
  - See DeepWiki documentation: https://docs.devin.ai/work-with-devin/deepwiki-mcp

## [0.4.14]

### Added

- **Enhanced BDA to IDP Sync for Pattern-1**
  - Separate "Sync from BDA" and "Sync to BDA" buttons in the UI for explicit directional control instead of bidirectional-only sync
  - Parallel blueprint processing for improved sync performance on configurations with many document classes
  - Orphaned blueprint cleanup automatically detects and removes BDA blueprints no longer defined in IDP configuration
  - Warning notifications for skipped properties due to BDA limitations (nested arrays/objects), with guidance to flatten schemas using top-level `$defs`
  - AWS standard blueprint filtering prevents unintended modifications to AWS-managed blueprints

- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Review Workflow Improvements**
  - **Review Ownership Model**: Reviewers must now claim documents using "Start Review" before editing, preventing concurrent edits
  - **Review In Progress Status**: New status displayed when a reviewer has claimed a document
  - **Filtered Document List for Reviewers**: Reviewers now see only documents pending review or their own in-progress reviews
  - **Admin Skip All Reviews**: Admins can skip all remaining section reviews without triggering document reprocessing
  - **Release Review**: Reviewers can release claimed documents back to pending status; Admins can release any review
  - **Review Completed By Field**: New column showing who completed or skipped the review (renamed from "Reviewed By")

- **Pattern-1 Edit Mode with Data-Only Editing and Reprocessing**
  - Added Edit Mode capability for Pattern-1 (BDA) stacks, enabling users to edit extraction data without modifying section structure
  - **Data-Only Editing**: Click "Edit Mode" then use "Edit Data" buttons on each section to open the Visual Editor for modifying predictions and ground truth
  - **Reprocessing Without BDA**: "Save and Reprocess" triggers evaluation and summarization steps without re-invoking Bedrock Data Automation (BDA)
  - **Section Structure Protection**: Section structure (IDs, classes, page assignments) remains read-only as managed by BDA blueprints
  - **Skip Logic Implementation**: State machine automatically detects existing pages/sections data and bypasses BDA invocation for reprocessing scenarios
  - **Use Cases**: Correct extraction errors, add baseline data for evaluation comparison, re-run evaluation after data corrections, update document summaries

### Changed


- **HITL Decoupled from Step Functions**: HITL review operations now update document status directly in DynamoDB without triggering workflow reprocessing, improving reliability and reducing unintended side effects

- **Renamed TestSet from RVL-CDIP-N-MP to DocSplit-Poly-Seq**
  - Updated Test Studio test set name to better reflect its purpose as a document splitting and classification benchmark
  - The underlying HuggingFace dataset source (`jordyvl/rvl_cdip_n_mp`) remains unchanged

- **Review Status Labels**: Renamed status values for consistency:
  - "Pending Review" → "Review Pending"
  - "Reviewed By" column → "Review Completed By"

### Fixed

- **HITL Decimal Serialization Error**: Fixed "Object of type Decimal is not JSON serializable" error when performing HITL operations (Start Review, Release Review, Skip All Reviews) by properly converting DynamoDB Decimal types

- **HITL Operations Clearing Estimated Cost**: Fixed issue where Start Review and Release Review operations were inadvertently clearing the Metering/Estimated Cost data by re-serializing the entire document; operations now update only HITL-specific fields

- **Pattern-1 Page/Section Number Alignment with Pattern-2 and Ground Truth**
  - Fixed page and section numbering mismatch between Pattern-1 (BDA) and Pattern-2 that caused evaluation failures when using shared test sets
  - **Root Cause**: BDA outputs 0-based indices while Pattern-2 and ground truth test sets use 1-based page IDs
  - **Solution**: Pattern-1 postprocessing now transforms S3 paths and Document model IDs to 1-based (`pages/1/`, `sections/1/`, `page_ids: ["1", "2"]`) while preserving 0-based `page_indices` arrays in result.json for internal consistency
  - **Key Distinction**: `page_indices` (array indices) remain 0-based, `page_id`/`section_id` (identifiers) are now 1-based
  - Both patterns now align correctly for evaluation with shared test sets and ground truth data

- **TIFF Image Format Support for Bedrock-Compatible Processing**
  - Fixed classification failure when processing TIFF image files ("Unsupported image format: TIFF")
  - OCR step now converts non-Bedrock-compatible formats (TIFF, BMP) to JPEG during page image extraction
  - Multi-page TIFF files handled like PDFs - each page becomes a separate document page

- **Discovery Feature Overwriting Existing Classes During Class Discovery**
  - Fixed issue where using Discovery to discover a new document type would delete all existing classes from the configuration
  - **Root Cause**: Custom config `classes` array was replacing Default `classes` array during runtime merge, causing loss of existing classes
  - **Solution**: Discovery now reads both Default and Custom classes, merges them with the newly discovered class, and saves the complete merged list to Custom config
  - Ensures discovered classes are additive to existing configuration rather than replacing it

## [0.4.13]

### Added

- **Rule Validation for Automated Compliance Assessment**
  - Added Rule Validation module enabling automated validation of extracted document data against configurable business rules and compliance criteria
  - **Key Capabilities**: Validate documents against any domain-specific compliance requirements (healthcare, financial, legal, insurance, manufacturing), customizable pass/fail criteria adaptable to industry needs, concurrent processing with intelligent chunking for large documents
  - **Dual Output Formats**: JSON for programmatic integration and Markdown for human review
  - **Integration**: Integrated into Pattern-2 workflow with AWS Step Functions parallel processing
  - **Example Use Cases**: Healthcare prior authorization validation, loan application compliance checking, contract clause verification, claims validation, quality control
  - **Configuration**: Fully configurable via `rule_validation` settings including custom recommendation options, model selection, and processing limits
  - **Documentation**: Complete guide in `docs/rule-validation.md` 

- **Visual Document Editor Enhancements**
  - **Improved Navigation Controls**: Mouse wheel zoom (no modifier key required) and click-and-drag panning for intuitive document image exploration
  - **Inline Field Editing with S3 Save**: Edit prediction values directly in the visual editor with change tracking, edit history, and direct S3 persistence
  - **Evaluation Baseline Editing**: Edit baseline (expected) values directly in the editor when evaluation data is available, with dedicated save/discard controls and independent change tracking from predictions
  - **Save & Reprocess Workflow**: After saving edits to predictions or baselines, trigger reprocessing to re-run summarization and evaluation with updated data; document automatically transitions through SUMMARIZING → EVALUATING → COMPLETE statuses
  - **Tabbed Interface**: New tabs for Visual Editor (form-based), JSON Editor (raw JSON with section filtering), and Revision History (audit trail with timestamps and field-level diffs)
  - **Smart Filtering**: Filter to show only low-confidence fields or evaluation mismatches; collapsible tree navigation with Expand/Collapse All controls
  - **Evaluation Comparison Mode**: Side-by-side predicted vs expected values with match indicators (✓/⚠), evaluation scores, and LLM-generated comparison reasons
  - **Section Navigation**: Previous/Next buttons to navigate between document sections without closing the editor

- **Section-Level DynamoDB Updates for Parallel Processing Optimization**
  - Added lightweight `updateDocumentStatus` mutation for status-only updates (~500 bytes vs ~100KB full document)
  - Added atomic `updateDocumentSection` mutation for individual section updates using `SET Sections[index] = :value`
  - **Scalability**: Eliminates DynamoDB throttling for very large documents by avoiding full-document read-modify-write cycles
  - **Real-time Updates**: Both new mutations now trigger `onUpdateDocument` subscription for UI synchronization
  - **Pattern-2/3 Integration**: Extraction and assessment functions now use section-level updates instead of full document rewrites


### Fixed

- **Visual Editor Confidence Alerts Filter Not Showing Null Fields** - Fixed issue where the "Confidence Alerts Only" filter in the Document Details visual editor was not displaying fields with `null` values, even when they had low confidence scores in `explainability_info`. The filter now properly detects and shows all low-confidence fields regardless of their value type.

- **Evaluation Failure for Schemas with Empty Nested Objects** - Fixed evaluation failing with "field_definitions must contain at least one field" error when document schemas contain nested objects with empty properties (e.g., `AccidentInformation: {type: object, properties: {}}`). Empty object properties are now automatically filtered during schema processing.

- **Evaluation Report Section Ordering** - Fixed document sections in evaluation markdown reports iterating in alphabetical order (1, 10, 11, 2, 3) instead of numerical order (1, 2, 3, 10, 11) by implementing natural sorting for section IDs

- **Confidence Alerts Mismatch for JSON Schema `$ref` Properties**
  - Fixed issue where confidence alerts in UI showed incorrect counts (all with confidence=0) that didn't match the actual extraction confidence scores in explainability_info JSON
  - **Root Cause**: Properties using JSON Schema `$ref` references were being incorrectly classified as "simple" types instead of "group" (object) types, causing false positive alerts

- **Configuration Import Float Type Error for DynamoDB**
  - Fixed "Float types are not supported. Use Decimal types instead" error when importing configuration files via CLI (`idp-cli config-upload`) or Web UI

## [0.4.12]

### Added

- **IDP SDK - Python SDK for Programmatic Document Processing**
  - New `idp_sdk` Python package (`lib/idp_sdk/`) providing a native Python interface for IDP operations
  - **IDPClient Class**: Wraps `idp-cli` commands with Pythonic methods for seamless integration into Python applications
  - **Key Methods**: `run_inference()`, `rerun_inference()`, `download_results()`, `status()`, `deploy()`, `delete()`, `delete_documents()`, `validate_manifest()`, `generate_manifest()`, `config_create()`, `config_validate()`, `config_download()`, `config_upload()`
  - **Pydantic Response Models**: Type-safe response objects (`BatchResult`, `ManifestResult`, `ValidationResult`, `ConfigCreateResult`, `ConfigValidationResult`) with proper Pydantic v2 compatibility
  - **Lambda Integration Example**: Complete SAM template and handler demonstrating SDK usage in AWS Lambda functions
  - **Documentation**: SDK reference guide (`docs/idp-sdk.md`) with CLI command mapping, usage examples, and Lambda patterns
  - **Easy Installation**: `pip install -e lib/idp_sdk` or `make setup` installs SDK with all dependencies
  - **Use Cases**: CI/CD pipelines, Lambda functions, automated workflows, custom integrations, and programmatic batch processing

- **Relocated idp-cli to lib/idp_cli_pkg/**
  - Moved `idp_cli/` directory to `lib/idp_cli_pkg/` to co-locate with other library packages
  - Updated all documentation and Makefile targets for new location

- **Modular System Defaults Architecture for Simplified Configuration**
  - Introduced pattern-specific system default files (`lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/config/system_defaults/pattern-{1,2,3}.yaml`) that provide default settings for OCR, classification, extraction, assessment, evaluation, summarization, discovery, and agents
  - User configurations now only need to specify `notes`, `classes`, and any intentional overrides - all other settings inherit from system defaults
  - Simplified all config_library configurations to minimal footprint (most now just 10-30 lines instead of hundreds)
  - Updated all README files in config_library and docs/configuration.md with inheritance documentation
  - **Benefits**: Simpler configs, automatic maintenance when defaults evolve, clearer visibility into customizations

- **Increased Extraction max_tokens Default** - Increased default `max_tokens` for extraction from 10,000 to 65,535 (Nova 2 Lite model maximum) to reduce LLM output truncation on long documents

- **IDP CLI Configuration Management Commands** - [GitHub Issue #87](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/87)
  - `idp-cli config-create` - Generate IDP configuration template from system defaults with selectable feature sets
  - `idp-cli config-validate` - Validate configuration file against system defaults and JSON schema
  - `idp-cli config-download` - Download current configuration from a deployed stack
  - `idp-cli config-upload` - Upload a local configuration file to a deployed stack's DynamoDB ConfigurationTable

- **IDP CLI Auto-Monitor for In-Progress Stack Operations**
  - Enhanced `idp-cli deploy` and `idp-cli delete` commands to automatically detect in-progress CloudFormation operations
  - **Smart Detection**: When running deploy/delete on a stack that's already creating, updating, deleting, or rolling back, the CLI automatically switches to monitoring mode instead of failing
  - **Seamless UX**: If you forget to use `--wait` on the first run, simply run the same command again to monitor progress
  - **Interactive Cancel for Delete**: When running `idp-cli delete` on a stack with CREATE or UPDATE in progress, offers option to cancel the current operation and proceed with deletion

- **New Make Targets and Documentation**
  - Added `make setup` target to install `idp-cli` and `idp_common` packages in development mode
  - Added `make ui-start` target to start UI dev server with optional `STACK_NAME` parameter for auto-generating `.env` from stack outputs
  - Documented all make targets in CONTRIBUTING.md including setup, lint, test, ui-start, commit, and DSR security scanning

- **IDP CLI New Commands for Operations and Testing**
  - Added `idp-cli load-test` command for throughput testing with configurable document rates (1-10,000/min) and dynamic schedule support via CSV files
  - Added `idp-cli stop-workflows` command for batch workflow termination with interactive confirmation and dry-run mode
  - Added `idp-cli delete-documents` command for removing documents and all associated data from the IDP system
  - Added `idp-cli remove-deleted-stack-resources` command for discovering and removing orphaned resources (CloudFront distributions, response header policies, CloudWatch log groups, AppSync APIs, IAM policies, S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables) left behind after IDP stacks are deleted, with multi-region stack discovery, interactive confirmation with "yes/skip all of type" options, and configurable `--check-stack-regions` option
  - Comprehensive unit tests added for all new CLI modules


### Changed


- **Scripts Directory Reorganization**
  - Consolidated development environment setup scripts into `scripts/setup/` subdirectory
  - Moved CI/CD scripts (`codebuild_deployment.py`, `integration_test_deployment.py`, `validate_buildspec.py`, `typecheck_pr_changes.py`, `validate_service_role_permissions.py`) into `scripts/sdlc/` subdirectory
  - Updated all references in `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Makefile`, and documentation

### Fixed

- **Fixed Document Details Page Not Loading After Browser Refresh for Document IDs Containing Forward Slashes**
  - Fixed issue where navigating to a document with a `/` in the Document ID (e.g., `folder/filename.pdf`) and then refreshing the browser would result in a blank page
  - **Root Cause**: When the browser refreshes a URL containing `%2F` (encoded slash), it automatically decodes it to `/`. React Router's `:objectKey` parameter only captures a single path segment, so `folder/filename.pdf` was being split into multiple segments, causing a route mismatch
  - **Solution**: Changed the route from `path=":objectKey"` to `path="*"` (wildcard route) to capture the full remaining path including any embedded slashes, and updated `DocumentDetails` component to extract the document key from `params['*']`

- **Improved UX for Document List and Document Details Action Buttons**
  - Added hover tooltips to all Document List toolbar buttons (Refresh, Download, Release Review, Abort, Reprocess, Delete) for better discoverability
  - Converted Abort, Reprocess, Delete, and Release Review buttons to icon-only display for a cleaner, more compact toolbar
  - Added `unlocked` icon to Release Review button to visually represent releasing a human review lock

- **Fixed Evaluation Failure for Documents with Truncated LLM Extraction Output**
  - Fixed evaluation service crash when extraction output contained unparsed `raw_output` instead of structured fields
  - **Root Cause**: When LLM extraction output is truncated (model hits max_tokens limit), the extraction service stores `{"raw_output": "..."}` which caused Pydantic validation errors during evaluation
  - **Solution**: 
    - Added `repair_truncated_json()` utility function that attempts to repair truncated JSON using multiple strategies (closing brackets, finding last complete element, extracting complete fields)
    - Integrated JSON repair into extraction service - most truncated output is now automatically repaired
    - Added detection of `raw_output` case in evaluation service with clear error messaging: "Extraction parsing failed... LLM output could not be parsed as valid JSON. This typically indicates truncated output (model hit max_tokens limit). Consider increasing max_tokens in extraction config."
    - Added metadata fields (`output_truncated`, `output_repaired`, `repair_method`) to track truncation/repair status
    - Enhanced evaluation service type coercion to provide appropriate defaults for required fields when LLM returns null values (prevents Pydantic validation errors like "Field required")

- **Fixed AgentRequestHandler Missing Lambda Invoke Permission for Error Analyzer Agent**
  - Fixed AccessDeniedException when clicking the Troubleshoot button in the Web UI

- **Fixed sectionSplitting=disabled Incorrectly Classifying Documents Based on Blank Pages - [GitHub Issue #167](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/167)**
  - Fixed bug where documents with blank pages could be incorrectly classified as `"unclassifiable_blank_page"` when using `sectionSplitting: disabled`
  - **Root Cause**: Page classification results arrive in completion order (not page order) from ThreadPoolExecutor, so blank/simple pages that finish processing first would end up at index 0 and incorrectly determine the document classification
  - **Solution**: Implemented majority voting strategy that:
    - Uses config-defined classes to determine voting eligibility (only pages matching valid document types from configuration can vote)
    - Automatically excludes any classification not in the config (blank pages, errors, LLM hallucinations)
    - Uses majority voting - most common valid classification wins
    - Uses first page's classification as tie-breaker for determinism
    - Falls back to first page's classification when all pages are unclassifiable
  - **Benefits**: Config-driven approach automatically adapts to any defined document classes without hardcoding exclusion lists
  - Updated documentation in `docs/classification.md` explaining the voting behavior

- **Test Results Config Export Not Properly Merging or Formatting**
  - Fixed issue where config export was downloading raw JSON with separate Default/Custom entries instead of merged config

### Removed

- **Obsolete Scripts Migrated to IDP CLI**
  - Removed `simulate_load.py` and `simulate_dynamic_load.py` (replaced by `idp-cli load-test`)
  - Removed `stop_workflows.sh` (replaced by `idp-cli stop-workflows`)
  - Removed `cleanup_orphaned_resources.py` (replaced by `idp-cli remove-deleted-stack-resources`)
  - Removed `lookup_file_status.sh` (replaced by `idp-cli status --document-id`)
  - Removed unused utilities: `add_lambda_layers.py`, `test_layer_build.py`, `test_pip_extras.py`, `compare_json_files.py`, `benchmark_utils/`

## [0.4.11]

### Added

- **Built-in Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Review System**
  - Replaced Amazon SageMaker A2I (Augmented AI) with a built-in HITL review system integrated directly into the Web UI
  - **Persona-Based Access Control**: 
    - **Admin**: Full access to all documents, can skip reviews, release review locks, and manage users
    - **Reviewer**: Access limited to documents pending HITL review, can claim and complete section reviews
  - **Review Workflow Features**:
    - Start Review button to claim document ownership and prevent concurrent edits
    - Section-level review with inline JSON editing and visual document viewer
    - Mark Section Review Complete to approve individual sections
    - Skip All Reviews (Admin only) to bypass pending reviews and continue workflow
    - Release Review to unlock document for other reviewers
  - **Real-time Status Updates**: Review Status, Review Status, Review Owner, and Reviewed By fields update in real-time across all user sessions via GraphQL subscriptions
  - See [Human-in-the-Loop Review Documentation](./docs/human-review.md) for detailed workflow information
  - **Note**: These are Phase 1 of HITL process updates. In upcoming phases, we are working to deliver futher improvements to human review capabilities with the ability to update document classification, extraction, and resubmit for incremental processing as part of a holistic approach to huiman reviews.
- **User Management**
  - New User Management page for Admin users to create and manage additional Admin & Reviewer accounts
  - Cognito user groups (Admin, Reviewer) for role-based access control
  - Automatic user synchronization with Cognito

- **DocSplit-Poly-Seq Test Set Auto-Deployment**
  - Automatically deploys 500 multi-page packet PDFs from HuggingFace dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/jordyvl/rvl_cdip_n_mp) during stack deployment
  - **13 Document Types**: invoice, email, form, letter, memo, resume, budget, news article, scientific publication, specification, questionnaire, handwritten, and language (non-English) documents
  - **Multi-Document Packets**: Each of 500 packets contains 2-10 distinct subdocuments of different types for comprehensive splitting and classification testing
  - **Packet Statistics**: 7,330 total pages across 2,027 document sections with average of 14.7 pages and 4.1 sections per packet
  - **Ground Truth Included**: Page-level classification and document boundary information for each packet. Extraction ground truth is not included.
  - **Evaluation Capabilities**: Enables testing of page-level classification accuracy, document splitting accuracy, and split order preservation. Does NOT enable testing of extraction accuracy since there is no extraction ground truth for this data set
  - Test set available in Test Studio UI alongside RealKIE-FCC-Verified and OmniAI-OCR-Benchmark datasets
  - Corresponding configs available in Configuration Library
  - Ideal for evaluating document splitting and classification accuracy in complex multi-document scenarios


### Changed


- **HITL Configuration**
  - HITL is now disabled by default in the configuration
  - Users must explicitly enable HITL in the Configuration page (Assessment & HITL Configuration section) to trigger human review workflows
  - `hitl_enabled` setting controls whether documents with low confidence trigger HITL review

### Removed

- **Amazon SageMaker A2I Resources**
  - Removed SageMaker A2I Flow Definition, Human Task UI, and Workteam resources
  - Removed A2I-related Lambda functions (`create_a2i_resources`, `get-workforce-url`)
  - Removed `EnableHITL` and `PrivateWorkteamArn` CloudFormation parameters


### Changed


- **Lambda Layers Architecture for Improved Build Efficiency**
  - Replaced bundled `idp_common` package dependencies in individual Lambda functions with three shared Lambda Layers
  - **Three Specialized Layers**:
    - `base` layer: Core functionality with docs_service and image extras
    - `reporting` layer: Reporting and analytics dependencies
    - `agents` layer: Agent-related dependencies
  - **Key Benefits**:
    - Reduced SAM build times by eliminating redundant dependency installation across 50+ Lambda functions
    - Layer content-based hashing ensures layers are only rebuilt when actual contents change
    - Automatic removal of Lambda runtime packages (boto3, botocore, etc.) reduces layer sizes by ~100MB
    - Layer zips cached locally and in S3, skipping uploads when content hasn't changed
  - **Build System Integration**: publish.py automatically builds, hashes, and uploads layers before SAM builds

- **Enhanced publish.py Performance and Logging**
  - **Consistent Logging Helpers**: Added 8 standardized logging methods (`log_phase`, `log_task`, `log_detail`, `log_success`, `log_cached`, `log_warning`, `log_error`) for uniform output formatting with colored icons and thread prefixes
  - **Timed S3 Uploads**: Added `upload_to_s3_with_timer()` helper with spinner animation, elapsed time display, and optimized `TransferConfig` for multi-threaded multipart uploads
  - **AWS CLI Config Library Sync**: Replaced boto3 ThreadPoolExecutor-based config library upload (~60 lines) with `aws s3 sync` command for built-in concurrency, delta sync (skip unchanged files), and simpler code
  - **Timing Breakdown Summary**: End-of-build summary shows top 4 time-consuming steps and percentages for build optimization insights
  - **Phase Headers**: Major build phases now display with clear `═══` separator lines and emojis for visual clarity

- **AppSync Resolvers Extracted to Nested Stack for Improved Template Modularity**
  - Refactored main CloudFormation template by extracting 130 AppSync resources into new nested stack architecture
  - **Extracted Components**:
    - Created `nested/appsync/template.yaml` containing GraphQLSchema, AppSyncServiceRole, Lambda resolver functions, LogGroups, DataSources, and Resolvers
    - Moved related Lambda functions from `src/lambda/` to `nested/appsync/src/lambda/` with colocated template definitions
    - Relocated GraphQL schema from `src/api/` to `nested/appsync/src/api/`
  - **Main Template Optimization**: Reduced resource count by keeping only core infrastructure (GraphQLApi, GraphQLApiLogGroup, AppSyncCwlRole, WAF resources, background worker functions)
  - **Build System Integration**: Updated `publish.py` to build nested stack in parallel with patterns
  - **Impact**: Main template now more manageable and faster to navigate, nested stack enables modular development of AppSync resources, parallel builds reduce overall build time

- **Consolidated Nested Stack Directory Structure**
  - Moved `options/bda-lending-project` and `options/bedrockkb` into `nested/` directory for simplified project organization
  - All CloudFormation nested stacks now located in single `nested/` directory alongside `appsync`, `bda-lending-project`, and `bedrockkb`
  - Updated build system to build only two categories concurrently (nested + patterns) instead of three (nested + patterns + options)
  - **Breaking Change**: Directory paths changed - `options/` → `nested/`. Existing work-in-progress branches will have merge conflicts in directory structure.


### Fixed

- **Fixed page_indices Reset Bug in Multi-Section Documents**
  - Fixed issue where all sections in document packets had page_indices starting from 0 instead of their actual position in the original document by pre-calculating indices during classification with access to global minimum page ID and storing in section.attributes for extraction step to use

- **Metering Table Added Requests**
  - Added requests count to bedrock metering data to track API request metrics
  
- **IDP CLI Stack Parameter Preservation During Updates**
  - Fixed bug where `idp-cli deploy` command was resetting ALL stack parameters to their default values during updates, even when users only intended to change specific parameters


### Upgrade Notes

- **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Upgrading from v0.4.11 or earlier**
  - **Complete all pending HITL workflows before upgrading**: Any documents waiting in SageMaker A2I human review loops will be orphaned as A2I resources are deleted during the upgrade
  - **Re-enable HITL after upgrade**: If you previously had `EnableHITL=true` CloudFormation parameter, you must now enable HITL through the Configuration page in the Web UI (Assessment & HITL Configuration → Enable HITL)
  - **User migration**: Existing Cognito users will need to be assigned to Admin or Reviewer groups for HITL access

  - **JSON Report Structure**: Full `field_comparison_details` array preserved in JSON output for programmatic analysis and consumption by analytics tools
  - **Benefits**: Quickly identify which specific nested fields cause aggregate score drops, compact problem view focusing on unmatched rows, complete diagnostic context with both high-level and granular perspectives

- **BDA / IDP Sync Feature for Pattern-1 Blueprint Synchronization**
  - Added bidirectional synchronization between BDA (Bedrock Data Automation) blueprints and IDP custom document classes
  - **Key Capabilities**: Automatic blueprint creation from IDP classes, automatic IDP class creation from BDA blueprints, intelligent change detection using DeepDiff, automatic cleanup of orphaned blueprints
  - **Sync Process**: Discovery configurations automatically trigger blueprint updates in BDA projects via `sync_bda_idp_resolver` Lambda function
  - **Schema Transformation**: Converts between IDP JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) and BDA blueprint format (draft-07) while preserving semantic meaning
  - **Important Limitations**: AWS managed blueprints excluded from sync, nested objects within objects not supported by BDA, nested arrays within object definitions not supported
  - **Best Practices**: Use flattened schema structures, place arrays only at top-level, validate schema structure before sync, monitor sync results for partial failures
  - **Use Cases**: Maintain consistency between IDP configuration and BDA blueprints, automatically propagate configuration changes, streamline document class management across both systems

- **Separate Pricing Configuration and Management UI**
  - Pricing configuration separated from general IDP configuration into dedicated system
  - New `config_library/pricing.yaml` file with centralized pricing for all AWS services (Textract, Bedrock, BDA, Lambda, SageMaker)

    - Edit pricing for individual APIs and units (e.g., `bedrock/us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0` → `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`)
    - Import/Export pricing configurations (JSON/YAML)
  - Used for cost estimation and reporting across all document processing workflows

- **Enhanced Document Pages Editor for Pattern-2 and Pattern-3**
  - Replaced confusing "View/Edit Data" button with intuitive "View Page Text" and "Edit Pages" workflow mirroring the Document Sections panel pattern
  - New modal editor with split-pane layout displaying plain text (left) and live markdown preview (right) - no more raw JSON visible to users
  - Added ability to reset page classifications to force reclassification and edit page text content with immediate S3 saves to prevent data loss
  - Implemented "Save & Process Changes" workflow for selective reprocessing - class resets trigger section removal and reclassification, text modifications trigger re-extraction while preserving sections
  - Resolves #164

### Fixed

- **Bedrock OCR Image Resizing Regression - Partial Dimension Configuration Support**
  - Fixed critical regression where configuring only `target_width` (without `target_height`) disabled all image resizing, causing Bedrock OCR to fail with "length limit exceeded" errors
  - **Root Cause**: OCR service used `and` condition requiring both dimensions, rejecting partial configs and sending full-resolution images that exceeded model input limits
  - **Solution**: Implemented aspect-ratio-preserving single-dimension resizing that calculates missing dimension from actual image aspect ratio

- **Test Studio Bug Fixes**
  - Fixed TestSets manual upload issues

- **Agentic Extraction Prompt Caching** - [GitHub PR #156](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/pull/156)
  - Removed additional cachepoints to prevent prompt caching conflicts in agentic extraction

- **GovCloud S3 Vectors Service Principal Deployment Failure** - [GitHub Issue #159](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/159)
  - Fixed CloudFormation deployment failure in GovCloud regions caused by S3 Vectors service not being available
  - **Root Cause**: KMS key policy referenced `indexing.s3vectors.${AWS::URLSuffix}` service principal which doesn't exist in GovCloud (us-gov-west-1, us-gov-east-1)

## [0.4.7]

### Added

- **MCP Integration Cross-Region Support for QuickSuite Integration**
  - Added cross-region support for QuickSuite integration enabling MCP connectivity across multiple AWS regions: us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-2

### Fixed

- **Stack deployment failure due to MCP Integration IAM Permissions - [GitHub Issue #154](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/154)**
  - Fixed missing permissions in AgentCoreGatewayManagerFunctionRole by creating the AgentCoreGateway execution role explicitly in the CloudFormation template instead of dynamically in the Lambda function

- **Post-Processing Lambda Hook Compression Handling - [GitHub Issue #155](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/155)**
  - Added intermediate decompression lambda to handle document decompression before invoking custom post-processing lambdas
  - **Root Cause**: After introducing document compression, the post-processing lambda hook was receiving compressed documents in the EventBridge payload, forcing external lambdas to import `idp_common` package and handle decompression manually
  - **Solution**: New `PostProcessingDecompressor` lambda function intercepts EventBridge events, decompresses documents using `Document.load_document()`, and invokes custom post-processors with decompressed payload
  - **Benefits**: Maintains backward compatibility, eliminates external dependencies (no `idp_common` import needed), keeps compression/decompression logic encapsulated within IDP stack, minimal performance impact (<1s latency)

- **Enhanced Bedrock Error Handling for Agent Companion Chat**
  - Implemented robust error handling system for Bedrock API errors in Agent Companion Chat feature with automatic retry and graceful degradation
  - **Automatic Retry with Exponential Backoff**: Configured boto3 with adaptive retry mode (3 attempts) and exponential back-off to prevent service overload
  - **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Created `BedrockErrorMessageHandler` to convert technical errors into clear, actionable messages for service unavailable (503), throttling (429), access denied (403), validation errors (400), timeouts (408), and quota exceeded scenarios
  - **Sub-Agent Error Handling**: When sub-agents (Analytics, Error Analyzer, Code Intelligence) encounter Bedrock errors, the orchestrator continues gracefully without crashing, only displaying the first error to avoid duplicates while allowing other sub-agents to complete

- **GovCloud Template Generation - Missing AppSync and MCP Resource Removal**
  - Fixed CloudFormation deployment error "Unresolved resource dependencies [DeleteDocumentResolverFunction]" when deploying GovCloud templates
  - **Test Studio Resources Added (36 resources)**: Added all Test Studio Lambda functions, AppSync resolvers, data sources, and supporting infrastructure to removal list (DeleteTestsResolver, TestRunnerResolver, TestResultsResolver, TestSetResolver, and all related functions, queues, and policies)
  - **MCP/AgentCore Gateway Resources Added (7 resources)**: Added MCP integration resources that depend on Cognito UserPool to removal list (AgentCoreAnalyticsLambdaFunction, AgentCoreGatewayManagerFunction, AgentCoreGatewayExecutionRole, AgentCoreGateway, ExternalAppClient)
  - **MCP Outputs Removed (8 outputs)**: Removed MCP-related outputs that reference deleted resources (MCPServerEndpoint, MCPClientId, MCPClientSecret, MCPUserPool, MCPTokenURL, MCPAuthorizationURL, DynamoDBAgentTableName, DynamoDBAgentTableConsoleURL)
  - **EnableMCP Default Changed**: Set `EnableMCP` parameter default to 'false' for GovCloud since MCP integration requires Cognito authentication infrastructure
  - **Impact**: GovCloud templates now deploy successfully without dependency errors, maintaining core document processing functionality in headless mode

## [0.4.6]

### Added

- **New State-Of-The-Art LLM Model Support**
  - Added support for Amazon Nova 2 Lite model (`us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0`, `eu.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0`)
  - Added support for Claude Opus 4.5 model (`us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-5-20251101-v1:0`, `eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-5-20251101-v1:0`)
  - Added support for Qwen 3 VL model (`qwen.qwen3-vl-235b-a22b`)
  - Available for configuration across all document processing steps

- **Test Studio for Comprehensive Test Management and Analysis**
  - Added unified web interface for managing test sets, running tests, and analyzing results directly from the UI
  - **Test Sets Tab**: Create and manage reusable test collections with three creation methods:
    - Pattern-based creation with file patterns to match existing data sets (Input Bucket and Test Set Bucket)
    - Zip upload with automatic extraction of `input/` and `baseline/` folder structure
  - **Test Executions Tab**: Unified interface combining test execution and results management:
    - Real-time status monitoring
    - Multi-select comparison for side-by-side test analysis
    - Integrated export and delete operations
  - **Key Features**: File structure validation, progress-aware status updates, cached metrics for improved performance, dual bucket support for flexible test organization
  - **Documentation**: Guide in `docs/test-studio.md` with architecture details and workflow examples

- **MCP Integration for External Application Access**
  - Added MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration enabling external applications (like Amazon Quick Suite) to access IDP analytics through AWS Bedrock AgentCore Gateway with secure OAuth 2.0 authentication
  - Implemented Analytics Agent with `search_genaiidp` tool for natural language queries of processed document data (statistics, trends, confidence scores, processing status)
  - Controlled by `EnableMCP` parameter (default: true); provides MCPServerEndpoint and authentication outputs for external application integration; documentation in `docs/mcp-integration.md`

- **Configurable Section Splitting Strategies for Enhanced Document Segmentation Control**
  - Added new `sectionSplitting` configuration option to control how classified pages are grouped into document sections
  - **Three Strategies Available**:
    - `disabled`: Entire document treated as single section with first detected class (simplest case)
    - `page`: One section per page preventing automatic joining of same-type documents (deterministic, solves Issue #146)
    - `llm_determined`: Uses LLM boundary detection with "Start"/"Continue" indicators (default, maintains existing behavior)
  - **Key Benefits**: Deterministic splitting for long documents with multiple same-type forms (e.g., multiple W-2s, multiple invoices), eliminates LLM boundary detection failures for critical government form processing, provides flexibility across simple to complex document scenarios
  - Resolves #146

### Changed


- **Improved Temperature and Top_P Parameter Logic for Deterministic Output**
  - Changed inference parameter selection logic to allow `temperature=0.0` for deterministic output (recommended by Anthropic and other model providers)
  - **New Logic**: Uses `top_p` only when it has a positive value (> 0); otherwise uses `temperature` including `temperature=0.0`
  - **Previous Logic**: Used `top_p` whenever `temperature=0.0`, preventing proper deterministic configuration
  - **Key Benefits**: Enables proper deterministic output with `temperature=0.0`, more intuitive parameter behavior, aligns with model provider best practices (Anthropic recommends `temperature=0` for consistent outputs)
  - **Affected Components**: Bedrock client (`lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/bedrock/client.py`), Agentic extraction service (`lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/extraction/agentic_idp.py`)
  - **Configuration Guidance**: Set `top_p: 0` to use `temperature` parameter; set `top_p` to positive value to override temperature
  - Set temperature to 0.0 in discovery config for deterministic discovery output (was previously set to 1.0)
  - Set top_p to 0.0 in all repo config files to force use of temperature setting by default.

- **Removed page image limit entirely across all IDP services**
  - removed image limits from multimodal inference steps (classification, extraction, assessment) following Amazon Bedrock API removal of image count restrictions. The system now processes all document pages without artificial truncation, with info logging to track image counts for monitoring purposes.
  - Resolves #147

- **Knowledge Base Vector Store Default Changed to S3 Vectors**
  - Changed default `KnowledgeBaseVectorStore` from `OPENSEARCH_SERVERLESS` to `S3_VECTORS` for cost-optimized deployments
  - S3 Vectors provides 40-60% lower storage costs with sub-second latency suitable for most use cases
  - OpenSearch Serverless remains available for applications requiring sub-millisecond query performance
  - No action required for existing deployments - only affects new stack deployments

### Fixed

- **UI: Document Schema Editor Regex Fields Not Persisting** - Fixed issue where Document Name Regex and Page Content Regex fields were not being saved in configuration or restored after page refresh. Fixes #151
- **Document Schema Builder Enum Support** - Fixed enum value handling in schema builder to properly support enumeration constraints for attribute definitions
- **Agentic Extraction Parameter Passing** - Fixed temperature and top_p parameters now correctly passed to agentic extraction service, enabling proper model behavior control
- **Document Schema Builder UI Labels** - Enhanced field labels and formats in document schema builder for improved clarity and user experience
- **Retry Mechanism Improvements** - Enhanced retry logic for more reliable error handling and recovery across document processing workflows
- **Type Safety Enhancements** - Improved type annotations and fixed undefined items handling to prevent runtime errors

  - Fixed bug where `text_confidence_uri` was being set to null in evaluation output for all three patterns
  - Root cause: AppSync service `_appsync_to_document()` method incorrectly mapped page URIs, and evaluation functions overwrote correct documents with corrupted AppSync responses

- **UI: Metering Data Not Displayed During Document Processing**
  - Fixed UI subscription query missing `Metering` field, preventing real-time cost display
  - Users can now see estimated costs accumulate in real-time without manual page refresh

  - Document class definitions now use industry-standard JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 format for improved flexibility and tooling integration
  - **Standards-Based Validation**: Leverage standard JSON Schema validators and tooling ecosystem for better configuration validation
  - **Enhanced Extensibility**: Custom IDP properties use standard JSON Schema extension pattern (`x-aws-idp-*` prefix) for clean separation of concerns
  - **Modern Data Contract**: Define document structures using widely-adopted JSON Schema format with robust type system (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`)
  - **Nested Structure Support**: Natural representation of complex documents with nested objects and arrays using JSON Schema's native `properties` and `items` keywords
  - **Automatic Migration**: Existing legacy configurations automatically migrate to JSON Schema format on first load - completely transparent to users
  - **Backward Compatible**: Legacy format remains supported through automatic migration - no manual configuration updates required
  - **Comprehensive Documentation**: New migration guide with format comparison, field mapping table, and best practices

- **IDP CLI Single Document Status Support with Programmatic Output**
  - Enhanced `status` command to support checking individual document status via new `--document-id` option as alternative to `--batch-id`
  - Added programmatic output capabilities with exit codes (0=success, 1=failure, 2=processing) for scripting and automation
  - JSON format output (`--format json`) provides structured data for parsing in CI/CD pipelines and scripts
  - Live monitoring support with `--wait` flag works for both batch and single document status checks
  - Mutual exclusion validation ensures only one of `--batch-id` or `--document-id` is specified
- **Error Analyzer CloudWatch Tool Enhancements**

### Fixed

- **UI Robustness for Orphaned List Entries** - [#102](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/102)
  - Fixed UI error banner "failed to get document details - please try again later" appearing when orphaned list entries exist (list# items without corresponding doc# items in DynamoDB tracking table)
  - **Root Cause**: When a document had a list entry but no corresponding document record, the error would trigger UI banner and prevent display of all documents in the same time shard
  - **Solution**: Enhanced error handling to gracefully handle missing documents - now only shows error banner if ALL documents fail to load, not just one
  - **Enhanced Debugging**: Added detailed console logging with full PK/SK information for both list entries and expected document entries to facilitate cleanup of orphaned records
  - **User Impact**: All valid documents now display correctly even when orphaned list entries exist; debugging information available in browser console for identifying problematic entries

  - **Features**: Fully backward compatible (works with or without extraction results), automatic section handling, error resilient with graceful continuation, comprehensive logging
  - **Configuration**: Enable by adding `{EXTRACTION_RESULTS}` placeholder to `task_prompt` in config.yaml
  - **Benefits**: Context-aware summaries referencing extracted values, improved accuracy and quality, better extraction-summary alignment

### Changed


- **Containerized Pattern-2 deployment pipeline** that builds and pushes all Lambda images via CodeBuild using the new Dockerfile, plus automated ECR cleanup and tests.
  - Lambda docker image deployments have a 10 GB image size limit compared to the 250 MB zip limit of regular deployment. This however doesn't allow for viewing the code in the AWS console.
    The change was introduced to accommodate the increased package size of introducing Strands into the package dependencies.

### Fixed
- **Discovery function times out when processing large documents.**
  - increase lambda discovery processor timeout to 900s
- **Corrected baseline directory structure documentation in evaluation.md**
  - Fixed incorrect baseline structure showing flat `.json` files instead of proper directory hierarchy
  - Updated to correct structure: `<document-name>/sections/1/result.json`
  - Reorganized document for better logical flow and user experience
- **GovCloud Template Generation - Removed GraphQLApi References** - #82
  - Fixed invalid GovCloud template generation where ProcessChanges AppSync resources were not being removed, causing "Fn::GetAtt references undefined resource GraphQLApi" errors
  - Updated `scripts/generate_govcloud_template.py` to remove all ProcessChanges-related resources and extend AppSync parameter cleanup to all pattern stacks
  - Fixed InvalidClientTokenId validation error by ensuring CloudFormation client uses the correct region when validating templates (commercial vs GovCloud)
- **Enhanced Processing Flow Visualization for Disabled Steps**
  - Fixed UX issue where disabled processing steps (when `summarization.enabled: false` or `assessment.enabled: false` in configuration) appeared visually identical to active steps in the "View Processing Flow" display
  - **Key Benefit**: Users can now immediately see which steps are actually processing data vs. steps that execute but skip processing based on configuration settings, preventing confusion about whether summarization or assessment ran
  - Limitation: the new visual indicators are driven from the current config, which may have been altered since the document was processed. We will address this in a later release. See Issue #86.

### Known Issues
- **GovCloud Deployments fail, due to lack of ARM support for CodeBuild. Fix targeted for next release.**

### Fixed

- **Problem with setting correctly formatted WAF IPv4 CIDR range** - #73

- **Duplicate Step Functions Executions on Document Reprocess - [GitHub Issue #66](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/66)**
  - Eliminated duplicate workflow executions when reprocessing large documents (>40MB, 500+ pages)
  - **Root Cause**: S3 `copy_object` operations were triggering multiple "Object Created" events for large files, causing `queue_sender` to create duplicate document entries and workflow executions
  - **Solution**: Refactored `reprocess_document_resolver` to directly create fresh Document objects and queue to SQS, completely bypassing S3 event notifications
  - **Benefits**: Eliminates unnecessary S3 copy operations (cost savings)

- **Page Limit Configuration for Classification Control**
  - Added `maxPagesForClassification` configuration option to control how many pages are used during document classification
  - **Default Behavior**: `"ALL"` - uses all pages for classification (existing behavior)
  - **Limited Page Classification**: Set to numeric value (e.g., `"1"`, `"2"`, `"3"`) to classify only the first N pages
  - **Important**: When using numeric limit, the classification result from the first N pages is applied to ALL pages in the document, effectively forcing the entire document to be assigned a single class with one section
  - **Use Cases**: Performance optimization for large documents, cost reduction for documents with consistent classification patterns, simplified processing for homogeneous document types

- **CloudFormation Service Role for Delegated Deployment Access**
  - Added example CloudFormation service role template that enables non-administrator users to deploy and maintain IDP stacks without requiring ongoing administrator permissions
  - Administrators can provision the service role once with elevated privileges, then delegate deployment capabilities to developer/DevOps teams
  - Includes comprehensive documentation and cross-referenced deployment guides explaining the security model and setup process

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where CloudFront policy statements were still appearing in generated GovCloud templates despite CloudFront resources being removed
- Fix duplicate Glue tables are created when using a document class that contains a dash (-). Resolved by replacing dash in section types with underscore character when creating the table, to align with the table name generated later by the Glue crawler - resolves #57.
- Fix occasional UI error 'Failed to get document details - please try again later' - resolves #58
- Fixed UI zipfile creation to exclude .aws-sam directories and .env files from deployment package
- Added security recommendation to set LogLevel parameter to WARN or ERROR (not INFO) for production deployments to prevent logging of sensitive information including PII data, document contents, and S3 presigned URLs
- Hardened several aspects of the new Discovery feature

- **Configuration-Based Summarization Control**
  - Summarization can now be enabled/disabled via configuration file `summarization.enabled` property instead of CloudFormation stack parameter
  - **Key Benefits**: Runtime control without stack redeployment, zero LLM costs when disabled, simplified state machine architecture, backward compatible defaults
  - **Implementation**: Always calls SummarizationStep but service skips processing when `enabled: false`
  - **Cost Optimization**: When disabled, no LLM API calls or S3 operations are performed
  - **Configuration Example**: Set `summarization.enabled: false` to disable, `enabled: true` to enable (default)

- **Configuration-Based Assessment Control**

### Removed

- **CloudFormation Parameters**: Removed `IsSummarizationEnabled` and `IsAssessmentEnabled` parameters from all pattern templates
- **Related Conditions**: Removed parameter conditions and state machine definition substitutions for both features
- **Conditional Logic**: Eliminated complex conditional logic from state machine definitions for summarization and assessment steps

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Configuration Migration Required**: When updating a stack that previously had `IsSummarizationEnabled` or `IsAssessmentEnabled` set to `false`, these features will now default to `enabled: true` after the update. To maintain the disabled behavior:
  1. Update your configuration file to set `summarization.enabled: false` and/or `assessment.enabled: false` as needed
  2. Save the configuration changes immediately after the stack update
  3. This ensures continued cost optimization by preventing unexpected LLM API calls
- **Action Required**: Review your current CloudFormation parameter settings before updating and update your configuration accordingly to preserve existing behavior

### Changed


- **Updated Python Lambda Runtime to 3.13**

### Fixed

- **Fixed B615 "Unsafe Hugging Face Hub download without revision pinning" security finding in Pattern-3 fine-tuning module** - Added revision pinning with to prevent supply chain attacks and ensure reproducible deployments
- **Fixed CloudWatch Log Group Missing Retention regression**
- **Security: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in FileViewer Component** - Fixed high-risk XSS vulnerability in `src/ui/src/components/document-viewer/FileViewer.jsx` where `innerHTML` was used with user-controlled data
- **Add permissions boundary support to new Lambda function roles introduced in previous releases**
- **Fixed OutOfMemory Errors in Pattern-2 OCR Lambda for Large High-Resolution Documents**
  - **Root Cause**: Processing large PDFs with high-resolution images (7469×9623 pixels) caused memory spikes when 20 concurrent workers each held ~101MB images simultaneously, exceeding the 4GB Lambda memory limit

### New Document-Based Architecture

The `idp_common_pkg` introduces a unified Document model approach for consistent document processing:

#### Core Classes

- **Document**: Central data model that tracks document state through the entire processing pipeline
- **Page**: Represents individual document pages with OCR results and classification
- **Section**: Represents logical document sections with classification and extraction results

#### Service Classes

- **OcrService**: Processes documents with AWS Textract or Amazon Bedrock and updates the Document with OCR results
- **ClassificationService**: Classifies document pages/sections using Bedrock or SageMaker backends
- **ExtractionService**: Extracts structured information from document sections using Bedrock

### Pattern Implementation Updates

- Lambda functions refactored, and significantly simplified, to use Document and Section objects, and new Service classes

### Key Benefits

1. **Simplified Integration**: Consistent interfaces make service integration straightforward
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Unified data model reduces code duplication and complexity
3. **Better Error Handling**: Standardized approach to error capture and reporting
4. **Enhanced Traceability**: Complete document history throughout the processing pipeline
5. **Flexible Backend Support**: Easy switching between Bedrock and SageMaker backends
6. **Optimized Resource Usage**: Focused document processing for better performance
7. **Granular Package Installation**: Install only required components with extras syntax

### Example Notebook

A new comprehensive Jupyter notebook demonstrates the Document-based workflow:

- Shows complete end-to-end processing (OCR → Classification → Extraction)
- Uses AWS services (S3, Textract, Bedrock)
- Demonstrates Document object creation and manipulation
- Showcases how to access and utilize extraction results
- Provides a template for custom implementations
- Includes granular package installation examples (`pip install "idp_common_pkg[ocr,classification,extraction]"`)

This refactoring sets the foundation for more maintainable, extensible document processing workflows with clearer data flow and easier troubleshooting.

### Refactored publish.sh script

- improved modularity with functions
- improved checksum logic to determine when to rebuild components
