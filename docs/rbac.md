# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Overview

The GenAI IDP Accelerator implements a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control system with **server-side enforcement** at the AppSync API layer, supplemented by UI-level navigation and action controls for a clean user experience. It also supports **config-version scoping** to restrict non-admin users to specific configuration versions (use cases).

## Roles

Four roles are defined as Cognito User Pool groups:

| Role | Cognito Group | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Admin** | `Admin` | Full access to all operations including user management and pricing |
| **Author** | `Author` | Read + write access to documents, configuration, tests, discovery |
| **Reviewer** | `Reviewer` | HITL review operations + limited document visibility |
| **Viewer** | `Viewer` | Read-only access to documents, configuration, agent chat |

### Multi-Group Support

Users can belong to multiple groups. Permissions are the **union** of all group permissions. For example, a user in both `Author` and `Reviewer` groups can both write documents and perform HITL reviews.

## Config-Version Scoping (Use Case Isolation)

### Overview

Non-admin users can optionally be assigned **allowedConfigVersions** — a list of configuration version names that restricts their view and access to only those use cases. This enables multi-tenant or multi-use-case deployments where different teams see only their relevant documents and configurations.

### How It Works

- **Admin users**: Always unrestricted — `allowedConfigVersions` is ignored even if set
- **All other roles** (Author, Reviewer, Viewer): If `allowedConfigVersions` is set and non-empty, the user can only:
  - See documents processed with those config versions (server-side filtering)
  - See and select those config versions in all version dropdowns
  - View/edit configuration for those versions only
- **No scope set** (empty/null): User sees all versions and documents (unrestricted)

### Scope Enforcement Points

| Layer | Enforcement |
|-------|-------------|
| **Document List** (server-side) | `listDocuments` Lambda resolver filters by `ConfigVersion` field using `allowedConfigVersions` from UsersTable |
| **Config Versions List** (server-side) | `getConfigVersions` Lambda resolver filters returned versions |
| **Config Version Access** (server-side) | `getConfigVersion` Lambda resolver rejects requests for out-of-scope versions |
| **Version Dropdowns** (UI) | `useConfigurationVersions` hook filters versions client-side for immediate UX |
| **Default Version Selection** (UI) | All version pickers auto-select the first available scoped version |

### Affected UI Components

All pages with config version selectors automatically respect scope:

| Page | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **View/Edit Configuration** | Shows only scoped versions in Versions panel; loads first scoped version |
| **Upload Documents** | Version picker shows only scoped versions |
| **Discovery** | Version picker shows only scoped versions |
| **Test Studio** | Test runner version picker shows only scoped versions |
| **Capacity Planning** | Version picker shows only scoped versions |
| **Reprocess Document** | Defaults to document's current ConfigVersion (if in scope) |
| **Document List** | Server-side filtered — only shows documents matching scoped versions |

### Managing User Scope

Admins can manage user scope via the **User Management** page:

1. **Create user with scope**: When creating a new user, optionally select config versions from the multiselect
2. **Edit user scope**: Click "Edit scope" on any non-Admin user row to add/remove config versions
3. **Remove scope**: Clear all selections to make a user unrestricted

Admin users' scope cannot be edited (they are always unrestricted).

### API: `getMyProfile`

All authenticated users can call `getMyProfile` to retrieve their own profile including `allowedConfigVersions`. This is used by the UI to apply client-side scope filtering immediately on page load.

```graphql
query GetMyProfile {
  getMyProfile {
    userId
    email
    persona
    allowedConfigVersions
  }
}
```

### API: `updateUser` (Admin-only)

```graphql
mutation UpdateUser($userId: ID!, $allowedConfigVersions: [String]) {
  updateUser(userId: $userId, allowedConfigVersions: $allowedConfigVersions) {
    userId
    email
    allowedConfigVersions
  }
}
```

## Enforcement Layers

### Layer 1: AppSync Schema Auth Directives (Server-Side)

Every GraphQL **mutation** and many **queries** have `@aws_cognito_user_pools(cognito_groups: [...])` directives that enforce access at the AppSync level. If a user's Cognito group is not in the allowed list, AppSync returns an **Unauthorized** error before any resolver code runs.

> **⚠️ Do NOT use `@aws_auth(cognito_groups: [...])` on this API.** The API has an additional authorization provider (`AWS_IAM`) configured, and on a multi-auth API AppSync **silently ignores** `@aws_auth` — every field decorated with it becomes reachable by *any* authenticated user regardless of group (a Viewer→Admin privilege escalation). Use `@aws_cognito_user_pools(cognito_groups: [...])`, which AppSync *does* evaluate on multi-auth APIs. As defense-in-depth, the required group is **also** enforced server-side in each privileged resolver Lambda (see Layer 2), so an operation is never reachable by an unauthorized caller even if a schema directive regresses.

**Key mutations and their allowed roles:**

| Mutation | Allowed Roles |
|----------|---------------|
| `deleteConfigVersion` | Admin |
| `createUser`, `updateUser`, `deleteUser` | Admin |
| `updatePricing`, `restoreDefaultPricing` | Admin |
| `updateModelConfigLimits`, `restoreDefaultModelConfigLimits` | Admin |
| `deleteDocument`, `updateConfiguration`, `setActiveVersion` | Admin, Author |
| `uploadDocument`, `reprocessDocument`, `abortWorkflow` | Admin, Author |
| `startTestRun`, `addTestSet`, `addTestSetFromUpload`, `deleteTests`, `deleteTestSets` | Admin, Author |
| `syncBdaIdp`, `uploadDiscoveryDocument`, `deleteDiscoveryJob`, `autoDetectSections` | Admin, Author |
| `copyToBaseline` | Admin, Author |
| `createFinetuningJob`, `deleteFinetuningJob` | Admin, Author |
| `processChanges`, `completeSectionReview`, `claimReview`, `releaseReview`, `skipAllSectionsReview` | Admin, Reviewer |
| `sendAgentChatMessage` | Admin, Author, Viewer (Reviewer excluded; also IAM for backend) |
| `deleteChatSession`, `updateChatSessionTitle`, `deleteAgentJob` | All authenticated users (session-scoped; see note below) |
| `updateAgentChatMessage` | All authenticated users (also IAM for backend) |

> **Agent Chat authorization**: `sendAgentChatMessage` and `listAvailableAgents` restrict Agent Chat to **Admin, Author, Viewer** (Reviewer excluded). The restriction is declared in `schema.graphql` **and** enforced server-side in each resolver via a `_caller_in_groups` check — the single REST route's Cognito authorizer only authenticates, so the group gate lives in the resolver. The IAM backend publish path has no Cognito identity and bypasses the check. The session-scoped operations (`deleteChatSession`, `getChatMessages`, `listChatSessions`, etc.) remain open to any authenticated user, bounded by **session scoping** (each user only sees their own sessions).
>
> *(Previously the Reviewer exclusion was UI-only — tracked as accepted-risk gap GAP-03 — because AppSync could not combine a `cognito_groups` restriction with `@aws_iam` on one field. AppSync has since been removed, so the real groups are now enforced.)*

**Key queries and their allowed roles:**

| Query | Allowed Roles |
|-------|---------------|
| `getDocument`, `listDocuments`, `listDocumentsByDateRange`, etc. | All authenticated (server-side filtering in resolvers) |
| `getFileContents`, `getStepFunctionExecution` | All authenticated |
| `getConfigVersions`, `getConfigVersion`, `getPricing`, `getModelConfigLimits`, `calculateCapacity` | Admin, Author, Viewer |
| `listAvailableAgents` | Admin, Author, Viewer (Reviewer excluded; enforced server-side — see Agent Chat note above) |
| `listChatSessions`, `getChatMessages`, `getAgentChatMessages` | All authenticated (session-scoped) |
| `submitAgentQuery`, `getAgentJobStatus`, `listAgentJobs` | Admin, Author, Viewer |
| `listConfigurationLibrary`, `getConfigurationLibraryFile` | Admin, Author, Viewer |
| `listDiscoveryJobs` | Admin, Author |
| `getTestRun`, `getTestRuns`, `getTestRunStatus`, `compareTestRuns`, `getTestSets`, `listBucketFiles`, `validateTestFileName` | Admin, Author |
| `listFinetuningJobs`, `getFinetuningJob`, `validateTestSetForFinetuning`, `listAvailableModels` | All authenticated (UI limited to Admin, Author) |
| `queryKnowledgeBase` | All authenticated |
| `sendChatDocumentMessage` (mutation), `onChatDocumentMessageUpdate` (subscription) | All authenticated; resolver enforces per-session ownership and processor enforces `allowedConfigVersions` scope on the target document |
| `listUsers` | All authenticated (non-admin sees only self in resolver) |
| `getMyProfile` | All authenticated |

**Note**: The `updateConfiguration` mutation is schema-level restricted to Admin+Author, but the resolver additionally enforces that `saveAsVersion` and `saveAsDefault` operations within that mutation are **Admin-only**.

### Layer 2: Server-Side Resolver Group Checks & Filtering

**Defense-in-depth group enforcement:** In addition to the Layer 1 schema
directives, each privileged resolver Lambda re-checks the caller's
`cognito:groups` claim at its entrypoint and rejects the request if the caller
is not in an allowed group. This ensures a privileged operation is never
reachable by an unauthorized caller even if a schema directive is missing or
misconfigured (for example, a regression back to the silently-ignored
`@aws_auth` directive). The required groups mirror the Layer 1 tables above
(Admin, Admin+Author, or Admin+Reviewer per operation).

**Identity-based filtering:** Lambda resolvers also apply finer-grained
filtering based on the caller's identity:

**Document Filtering:**
- **Admin**: See all documents
- **Author/Viewer**: See all documents, filtered by `allowedConfigVersions` if scope is set
- **Reviewer-only**: See only HITL-pending documents + their own completed reviews, plus config-version scope

**Configuration Filtering:**
- `getConfigVersions`: Returns only versions in user's scope (or all if unrestricted)
- `getConfigVersion`: Rejects request if version is not in user's scope

**User Management Filtering:**
- `listUsers`: Admin sees all users; non-admin sees only their own profile
- `getMyProfile`: Returns the calling user's own profile (including `allowedConfigVersions`)

### Layer 3: UI Adaptation (UX Convenience)

The UI adapts based on the user's role and scope:
- Navigation sidebar shows only relevant features per role
- Action buttons (delete, reprocess, upload, save, import) are hidden for roles that can't perform those actions
- Version dropdowns are automatically filtered to show only scoped versions
- The top navigation badge shows the user's role with color coding (blue=Admin, green=Author, grey=Reviewer/Viewer)
- **Admin-only buttons**: "Save as Version", "Save as Default" in Configuration; Import/Restore/Save in Pricing and Model Limits
- **Pricing page**: Shows "View Pricing" (read-only) for non-admin; "Pricing Configuration" (editable) for admin
- **Model Limits page**: Shows "View Model Limits" (read-only) for non-admin; "Model Limits Configuration" (editable) for admin

**This layer is NOT a security boundary** — it's purely for user experience. Security is enforced at Layers 1 & 2.

## User Management

Admins can create users with any of the four roles via the User Management page. Each user is:
1. Created in DynamoDB (source of truth)
2. Synced to Cognito (for authentication)
3. Added to the appropriate Cognito group (for authorization)
4. Optionally assigned `allowedConfigVersions` for config-version scoping

### User Table Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `userId` | Unique identifier (UUID) |
| `email` | User's email address (used as Cognito username) |
| `persona` | Role: Admin, Author, Reviewer, or Viewer |
| `status` | User status (active) |
| `allowedConfigVersions` | Optional list of config version names for scoping |
| `createdAt` | Creation timestamp |

## Adding New Roles

To add a new role:
1. Add a `AWS::Cognito::UserPoolGroup` in `template.yaml`
2. Add the group name to relevant `@aws_cognito_user_pools(cognito_groups: [...])` directives in `schema.graphql` (do **not** use `@aws_auth` — see Layer 1 warning), and update the corresponding server-side group check in the resolver Lambda
3. Update the `VALID_PERSONAS` dict in `src/lambda/user_management/index.py`
4. Add role detection in `src/ui/src/hooks/use-user-role.ts`
5. Add navigation items in `src/ui/src/components/genaiidp-layout/navigation.tsx`
6. Pass the new group as an environment variable to the UserManagement Lambda

## Known Limitations

- **Knowledge Base queries** do not currently enforce config-version scope. KB results may include documents from out-of-scope config versions.
- **Agent Companion Chat** analytics queries (Athena) do not filter by config-version scope.
- **GetDocument API** (direct document access by URL) does not enforce config-version scope at the resolver level. UI navigation hides out-of-scope documents, but direct API access is not blocked.
- **Custom Model Fine-tuning** jobs are global — not scoped by `allowedConfigVersions`. A scoped Author can see all fine-tuning jobs and create jobs from any test set. However, when applying a custom model to a configuration version (via the "Create Config Version" modal), the config-version scope IS enforced — the Author can only target versions within their scope.
- These limitations are tracked for Phase 3 implementation.
