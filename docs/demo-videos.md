## Overview & Getting Started

### Solution Overview
A scalable, serverless solution for automated document processing and information extraction using AWS services.

**Duration**: ~3 minutes


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc2652b5-a9cc-42d7-9975-887c8320a2f5


**Related Documentation**: [README.md](../README.md)

---

### Quick Start
Go from a plain-language description of your document type to a working, active IDP configuration — entirely through conversation, with no manual schema editing. Solves the cold-start problem for fresh deployments.

The solution combines Amazon Textract and Bedrock to automatically process complex medical documents, transforming days-long manual processes into minutes.

**Key Topics Covered:**
- Automated classification and data extraction for medical documents
- Criteria validation while maintaining HIPAA compliance
- Live demonstrations and architecture deep-dives
- Implementation strategies for scalable document processing pipelines
- Integration patterns with existing healthcare systems
- Best practices for ROI optimization
- Eliminating document processing bottlenecks with regulatory compliance

**Duration**: ~1 hour

**Platform**: YouTube

[![Healthcare Document Processing Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/7CbJoeEFyZg/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/live/7CbJoeEFyZg?t=1174s)

[Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/7CbJoeEFyZg?t=1174s)

**Replicate This Demo**: You can now run this exact healthcare demo yourself using the pre-configured sample and config files included in the repository:
- **Sample Document**: [healthcare-multisection-package.pdf](../samples/healthcare-multisection-package.pdf)
- **Configuration**: [Pattern-2 Healthcare Config](../config_library/unified/healthcare-multisection-package/config.yaml)

These are the same files used in the video demonstration and can be deployed with the IDP CLI or web UI.
