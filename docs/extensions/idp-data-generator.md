# Test Set Generator

The **Test Set Generator** is an installable [Feature Platform](../feature-platform.md)
extension that generates labeled synthetic document test sets — a PDF plus a
paired ground-truth JSON label per document — using the open-source
[SEED](https://awslabs.github.io/synthetically_engineered_evaluation_data)
generator (`seed-data`) on an Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime.

Generate test sets from a plain-language description of a document type, or from
an existing configuration version's class schema. The output lands in the host's
Test Set bucket in the layout [Test Studio](../test-studio.md) auto-discovers, so
generated documents are immediately usable for evaluation runs.

> The extension keeps the stable feature id `idp-data-generator` (used by the
> host UI, IAM tags, and registration); only the display name is "Test Set
> Generator".

## What it does

Produces realistic, schema-conformant synthetic documents with ground-truth
labels for evaluating OCR, classification, and extraction:

- **Two generation modes** — from a document-type description (a schema is
  authored on the fly), or from an existing configuration version + document
  class (the class schema seeds generation).
- **Scenario theming** — an optional high-level theme (e.g. "small-business
  owners in retail") that the generator diversifies into distinct documents. A
  **Suggest** button proposes themes with Bedrock.
- **Quality control** — a quality setting (faster vs. higher quality) tunes how
  many generation/critique passes SEED runs per document.
- **Labeled output** — each document is emitted as `input/<doc>.pdf` plus
  `baseline/<doc>.pdf/sections/<n>/result.json` (document class + inference
  result), the standard IDP test-set layout Test Studio reads.
- **Optional image augmentation** — scan/fax-style aging effects for
  robustness testing (requires `seed-data>=0.0.6`).
- **Cost estimate** — the modal shows an estimated cost/time band before you
  start a run.

## Where to use it

Once installed, the generator is reachable three ways:

- **Test Studio → Test Sets → Generate Test Set** — a modal (shown only
  when this extension is installed) to generate from a description or a
  configuration version/class, with scenario, quality, and document-count
  controls. Choose a **destination**: create a new test set (a unique name is
  required — a name that already exists is rejected) or add the generated
  documents to an existing test set. The resulting test set appears in the list
  when the background job completes; click a test set's name to preview its
  documents without running a test execution.
- **View/Edit Configuration → Document Schema** — a **Generate test set** button
  deep-links into Test Studio with the modal pre-filled for the current
  configuration version.
- **Quick Start** — the onboarding agent discovers the extension and can
  generate synthetic documents directly (including passing a scenario).

## Installation

Install like any Feature Platform extension: open **Extensions (Preview)** in the
web UI, select **Test Set Generator**, and launch the CloudFormation stack (it
attaches to the host by `MainStackName`). Installing builds the generator's
AgentCore Runtime image (CodeBuild → ECR → AgentCore) — allow a few minutes on
first install.

The generator requires Amazon Bedrock model access for the models SEED uses
(Claude, Nova, GPT-OSS, etc.); requests run in your account.

## How it works

A self-contained extension stack that plugs into the host contract:

- **FeatureApi** (HTTP API + Cognito JWT) — `POST /generate` and
  `/generate-from-config` enqueue a job (each takes a destination: `testSetName`
  to create a new set, or `testSetId` to append to an existing one; both require
  the caller to be in the `Admin` or `Author` group); `POST /estimate-cost`
  returns a cost/time band; `POST /suggest-scenario` proposes scenario themes via
  Bedrock; `GET /jobs` lists in-flight jobs and `GET /jobs/{id}` returns one
  job's status.
- **BootstrapProcessor** (SQS-driven Lambda) — authors/resolves the document
  class schema, writes it into a configuration version, and invokes the
  AgentCore Runtime asynchronously.
- **AgentCore Runtime** (arm64 container) — runs the SEED pipeline
  (`seed-data` + the accelerator's `idp_common.synthesis` adapter), writes the
  test set to the host Test Set bucket, and records terminal job status in the
  extension's tracking table.
- **Job status** is feature-owned (a DynamoDB tracking table), surfaced through
  the FeatureApi.

## Command line

The [`idp-cli bootstrap`](../idp-cli.md) command runs the same synthesis pipeline
in-process (prompt → schema → configuration version → labeled test set), with
`--count`, `--threshold`, and `--augment` options. It uses the
`idp_common[synthesis]` adapter directly rather than the deployed extension.
