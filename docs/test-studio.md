# Test Studio

The Test Studio provides a comprehensive interface for managing test sets, running tests, and analyzing results directly from the web UI.

## Overview

The Test Studio consists of two main tabs:
1. **Test Sets**: Create and manage reusable collections of test documents
2. **Test Executions**: Execute tests, view results, and compare test runs

## Generating synthetic test sets

When the [Test Set Generator](extensions/idp-data-generator.md) extension is
installed, the **Test Sets** tab shows a **Generate Test Set** button. It
opens a modal to generate labeled synthetic documents (PDF + ground-truth JSON)
— either from a plain-language description of a document type, or from an
existing configuration version's document class. You can add an optional
**scenario** theme (with an AI **Suggest** helper), choose a **quality** level
(faster vs. higher quality), and see an estimated cost/time band before starting.
Generation runs as a background job; the resulting test set appears in the list
when it completes. Click a test set's name to preview its generated documents
without running a test execution. See the
[Test Set Generator extension](extensions/idp-data-generator.md) for details and
installation.


## Pre-Deployed Test Sets

The accelerator automatically deploys **four benchmark datasets** from HuggingFace as ready-to-use test sets during stack deployment:

1. **RealKIE-FCC-Verified**: 75 FCC invoice documents
2. **OmniAI-OCR-Benchmark**: 293 diverse document images across 9 formats
3. **DocSplit-Poly-Seq**: 500 multi-page packets with 13 document types
4. **Fake-W2-Tax-Forms**: 2,000 synthetic US W-2 tax form images with 45-field ground truth
5. **ConfBench**: 1,346 FCC invoice documents with noise augmentation (75 originals × up to 18 degradation variants)

All datasets are deployed automatically with zero manual steps required. Each test set has a corresponding **managed configuration version** (e.g., `fake-w2`, `docsplit`) that is auto-selected in Test Studio when the test set is chosen. See [Configuration — Managed Configuration Versions](configuration.md#managed-configuration-versions) for details.

### RealKIE-FCC-Verified

**Source**: https://huggingface.co/datasets/amazon-agi/RealKIE-FCC-Verified

This dataset contains 75 invoice documents sourced from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d952fd37-1bd0-437f-8f67-5a634e9422e0

#### Deployment Details

During stack deployment, the system automatically:

1. **Downloads Dataset Metadata** from HuggingFace parquet file (75 documents)
2. **Downloads PDFs** directly from HuggingFace's `pdfs/` directory
3. **Uploads PDFs** to `s3://TestSetBucket/realkie-fcc-verified/input/`
4. **Extracts Ground Truth** from `json_response` field (already in accelerator format!)
5. **Uploads Baselines** to `s3://TestSetBucket/realkie-fcc-verified/baseline/`
6. **Registers Test Set** in DynamoDB with metadata

#### Key Features

### Key Features

- **Fully Automatic**: Complete deployment during stack creation with zero user effort
- **Direct PDF Downloads**: PDFs are downloaded directly from HuggingFace's repository (no image conversion needed)
- **Complete Ground Truth**: Structured invoice attributes (Agency, Advertiser, GrossTotal, PaymentTerms, AgencyCommission, NetAmountDue, LineItems)
- **Benchmark Ready**: 75 FCC invoice documents ideal for extraction evaluation

#### Corresponding Config

Use with: `config_library/unified/realkie-fcc-verified/config.yaml`

---

### ConfBench

**Source**: https://huggingface.co/datasets/amazon/ConfBench

ConfBench extends the 75 verified FCC invoice documents from RealKIE-FCC-Verified with up to 18 noise-augmented variants per document, producing 1,346 (document, noise\_variant) pairs. It is designed for confidence calibration research, OCR robustness evaluation, and key information extraction (KIE) benchmarking under realistic document degradation conditions.

#### Noise Variants

Each original document is augmented using the [Augraphy](https://github.com/sparkfish/augraphy) library with OCR-safe parameter settings. Variants include:

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `original` | Clean source document (no augmentation) |
| `default` | Default Augraphy pipeline |
| `archetype3`–`archetype11` | Named archetype degradation pipelines |
| `custom12`–`custom23` | Custom noise configurations |

#### Dataset Schema

Each row in the Parquet file represents one `(document, noise_variant)` pair:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | `{doc_hash}__{noise_variant}.pdf` — unique key and PDF filename |
| `noise_variant` | string | Noise pipeline name (e.g., `original`, `default`, `archetype3`) |
| `page_count` | int | Number of pages in the document |
| `json_response` | struct | Ground truth matching the RealKIE-FCC-Verified invoice schema |

Ground truth fields: `Agency`, `Advertiser`, `GrossTotal`, `PaymentTerms`, `AgencyCommission`, `NetAmountDue`, `LineItems[]`.

#### Deployment Details

During stack deployment, the system automatically:

1. **Downloads Dataset Metadata** from HuggingFace parquet file (1,346 rows)
2. **Downloads PDFs** directly from HuggingFace's `pdfs/` directory
3. **Uploads PDFs** to `s3://TestSetBucket/confbench/input/`
4. **Extracts Ground Truth** from `json_response` field
5. **Uploads Baselines** to `s3://TestSetBucket/confbench/baseline/`
6. **Registers Test Set** in DynamoDB with metadata

Due to the volume (1,346 files), deployment uses a chunked self-invocation pattern — the Lambda processes 100 files per invocation and chains itself asynchronously until all files are deployed. Transient CDN errors are retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff. A deployment report is written to `s3://TestSetBucket/confbench/_deploy_state/{version}/failed_files.json`.

#### Key Features

- **Scale**: 1,346 documents covering 75 unique invoices × up to 18 noise levels
- **Robustness Testing**: Evaluate model performance across degradation severity
- **Confidence Calibration**: Assess extraction confidence under realistic noise conditions
- **Consistent Schema**: Same ground truth format as RealKIE-FCC-Verified for direct comparison

#### Corresponding Config

Use with: `config_library/managed_config/confbench/config.yaml`

### DocSplit-Poly-Seq

**DocSplit Dataset**: https://huggingface.co/datasets/amazon/doc_split  
**Documents Source**: https://huggingface.co/datasets/jordyvl/rvl_cdip_n_mp

The DocSplit dataset contains 500 multi-page packet PDFs created by combining pages from 13 different document types. Documents are sourced from the RVL-CDIP-N-MP dataset. Each packet contains multiple subdocuments of different types to test classification and document splitting capabilities.

#### Benchmark Methodology

**DocSplit-Poly-Seq (Multi Category Documents Concatenation Sequentially):** Creates document packets by first determining a target page count (5-20 pages), then sequentially selecting documents from different categories without repetition. For each selected document, all of its pages are included while preserving the original page ordering, and this process continues until the target page count is reached.

This benchmark simulates the most common real-world scenario where heterogeneous documents are assembled into packets, as observed in medical claims processing where prescription records, laboratory results, and insurance forms are concatenated. The varying document types test models' ability to detect inter-document boundaries based on content and structural transitions, a fundamental requirement for accurate packet splitting.

#### Document Types

The dataset includes 13 document types spanning common business and administrative documents:
- **invoice**, **email**, **form**, **letter**, **memo**, **resume**
- **budget**, **news article**, **scientific publication**, **specification**
- **questionnaire**, **handwritten**, **language** (non-English documents)

#### Packet Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Document Packets | 500 |
| Total Pages | 7,330 |
| Total Sections | 2,027 |
| Avg Pages/Packet | 14.7 |
| Avg Pages/Sections | 3.62 |
| Avg Sections/Packet | 4.1 |

## Test Sets

### Creating Test Sets
1. **Pattern-based**: Define file patterns (e.g., `*.pdf`) with bucket type selection
   - **Input Bucket**: Scan main processing bucket for matching files
   - **Test Set Bucket**: Scan dedicated test set bucket for matching files
   - **Description**: Optional description field (max 500 characters) to document the test set purpose
   - **Document Classification Type**: Optional metadata to categorize test set classification characteristics:
     - **Unspecified**: No classification type specified (default)
     - **Single Class**: All documents in test set belong to same document class
     - **Multi Class**: Documents span multiple document classes
     - **Packet Splitting**: Test set designed for document splitting evaluation (packets containing multiple sub-documents)
   - **Modified after filter**: Optional time filter to include only recently modified files — choose a preset (Last 1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days, etc.) or pick a custom date/time (useful for incremental workflows)
2. **Zip Upload**: Upload zip containing `input/` and `baseline/` folders
   - **Description**: Optional description field (max 500 characters) to document the test set purpose
   - **Document Classification Type**: Optional metadata (same values as pattern-based creation)
3. **Direct Upload**: Files uploaded directly to TestSetBucket are auto-detected

### Browsing Test Set Documents and Ground Truth

Click a COMPLETED test set's name in the table (or select it and click
**Browse Documents**) to open the test set browser at
`/test-studio/sets/<test-set-id>`. It shows a paginated table of the set's
input documents with a first-page thumbnail preview, size, last-modified
time, and ground-truth section count. Thumbnails are rendered lazily in the
browser as rows scroll into view (for PDFs only the byte ranges needed for
page 1 are fetched, so large packets stay cheap). Each document name links
to a per-document detail page (`/test-studio/sets/<id>/doc/<file>`) —
mirroring the app's Document List → Document Details structure.

The document detail page offers two views:

- **View Source Document** — the original PDF or image rendered inline.
- **Edit Ground Truth** (read-only for non-Admin/Author roles) — a visual
  editor with the document's page images on the left and an editable form
  over the baseline's `inference_result` on the right, plus a raw JSON tab.
  Multi-section baselines get a section selector that also scopes the page
  images to that section's `split_document.page_indices`; when a baseline
  carries `explainability_info` geometry (created via **Copy to Baseline**),
  focusing a field highlights its bounding box on the page image. Saves write
  back to the section's `baseline/.../result.json` and append an
  `_editHistory` provenance entry.

Note: page images are rendered in the browser from the source document
(test set documents are unprocessed, so no pipeline page images exist).
TIFF sources cannot be previewed in-browser; ground truth editing still works.

### Editing Test Sets

You can edit a test set's description and document classification type after creation:

1. Select a single test set in the table
2. Click **Edit** to open the edit modal
3. Update the **Description** (max 500 characters) or **Document Classification Type**
4. Click **Update** to save changes

### Adding Documents to Existing Test Sets

You can incrementally add documents to a COMPLETED test set — useful for building up test sets over time as new documents are processed and human-reviewed.

1. Select a single COMPLETED test set in the table
2. Click **Add Documents** and choose a source:
   - **From Existing Files**: Select a bucket, enter a file pattern, and optionally filter by modification time
   - **From Upload**: Upload a zip file containing new documents and their baselines
3. The test set shows an "Updating..." status while files are being added
4. After completion, the file count is updated and a result message is displayed

**Key behaviors:**
- **Automatic baseline filtering** (Input Bucket): Files without matching baseline data in the evaluation bucket are automatically excluded rather than failing. A result message reports the counts (e.g., "Added 8 of 12 files (4 excluded - no baseline data)").
- **Idempotent**: Adding a document that already exists overwrites it. File counts are always recounted from S3 for accuracy.
- **Prepopulated file pattern**: The file pattern field is pre-filled with the pattern used to create the test set, so you can reuse or adjust it.
- **Time filter**: Use the "Modified after" filter — choose a preset (Last 1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days) or select "Custom date/time" with a date picker to specify an exact cutoff. This makes it easy to pick up recently reviewed documents without crafting complex patterns.

### File Structure Requirements
```
my-test-set/
├── input/
│   ├── document1.pdf
│   └── document2.pdf
└── baseline/
    ├── document1.pdf/
    │   └── [ground truth files]
    └── document2.pdf/
        └── [ground truth files]
```

### Validation Rules
- Each input file must have corresponding baseline folder
- Baseline folder name must match input filename exactly
- When using Input Bucket as source, files without baselines are automatically excluded (not treated as an error)
- Status: COMPLETED (valid), FAILED (validation errors), QUEUED/COPYING (creating), UPDATING (adding documents)

### Upload Methods
1. **UI Zip Upload**: S3 event → Lambda extraction → Validation → Status update
2. **Direct S3 Upload**: Detected via refresh button or automatic polling

## Test Executions

### Running Tests
1. Select test set from dropdown
2. **Optional**: Select configuration version to use for processing

- **RUNNING**: Files being copied and processed
- **EVALUATING**: Documents processed, evaluation in progress
- **COMPLETED**: Test finished successfully with all documents evaluated
- **PARTIAL_COMPLETE**: Test finished with some documents failed
- **FAILED**: Errors during processing
- **ABORTED**: Test run manually stopped before completion

### Aborting Test Runs
Test runs with status **QUEUED** or **RUNNING** can be aborted:
1. Click the "Abort" button next to the running test
2. The system will:
   - Stop all pending document processing workflows
   - Preserve results from already-completed documents
   - Update test run status to **ABORTED**
   - Calculate metrics for completed documents
3. View partial results including:
   - Accurate count of completed vs. total files (e.g., "48/50 files processed")
   - Evaluation metrics for completed documents
   - Cost breakdown for processed documents

**Note**: Test runs with status **EVALUATING**, **COMPLETED**, **PARTIAL_COMPLETE**, or **FAILED** cannot be aborted.

Test Studio uses Stickler's `BulkStructuredModelEvaluator` for accurate metric aggregation across multiple documents:

**How It Works:**
1. **Individual Evaluation**: Each document is evaluated with `include_confusion_matrix=True` to capture detailed field-level metrics
2. **Storage**: Raw Stickler comparison results are stored in S3 at `{doc_path}/evaluation/results.json` under the `stickler_comparison_result` field
3. **Aggregation**: When viewing test results, the system:
   - Scans DynamoDB for all documents in the test run (PK pattern: `doc#{test_run_id}*`)
   - Loads evaluation results from S3
   - Extracts `stickler_comparison_result` from each document
   - Uses `aggregate_from_comparisons()` to compute aggregate metrics
4. **Fallback**: Athena-based aggregation remains available for backward compatibility with older data

**Benefits:**
- **More Accurate**: Uses Stickler's confusion matrix for precise field-level metrics
- **Consistent**: Same evaluation engine for single documents and bulk aggregation
- **Efficient**: No Athena queries needed for new data
- **Cost Effective**: Reduces Athena query costs

### Field-Level Metrics

Test results include detailed per-field extraction performance metrics displayed in an interactive table with optional confidence calibration columns (Stickler v0.4.0+):

**Displayed Columns:**
1. **Field Name**: The name of the extracted field (hierarchical with expand/collapse)
2. **Accuracy**: `(TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN)` - Overall correctness
3. **Precision**: `TP / (TP + FP)` - Accuracy of positive predictions
4. **Recall**: `TP / (TP + FN)` - Coverage of actual positives
5. **AUROC** (when available): Area Under ROC Curve - how well confidence discriminates correct from incorrect (1.0 = perfect)
6. **ECE** (when available): Expected Calibration Error - measures calibration quality (0.0 = perfect)
7. **Brier** (when available): Brier Score - mean squared error between confidence and outcome (0.0 = perfect, 0.25 = random)
8. **ECARB@30** (when available): Error Capture at Budget 30% - practical metric showing % of errors caught when reviewing lowest-confidence 30% of data, with gain multiplier vs random (e.g., "89% (3.0x)")
9. **TP** (True Positives): Correctly extracted values
10. **FP** (False Positives): Incorrectly extracted values
11. **TN** (True Negatives): Correctly identified as absent
12. **FN** (False Negatives): Missed extractions

**Features:**
- **Hierarchical Display**: Nested fields with expand/collapse controls
- **Searchable**: Filter fields by name to quickly find specific metrics
- **Sortable**: Click any column header to sort by that metric (including confidence columns)
- **Column Preferences**: Show/hide columns via preferences menu (confidence columns auto-added when data available)
- **Expandable Section**: Collapsed by default to keep results view clean
- **Paginated**: 10 fields per page for easy navigation
- **Resizable Columns**: Adjust column widths as needed
- **Backward Compatible**: Confidence columns only shown for test runs with Stickler v0.4.0+ data
- **Interactive Help**: Info icons next to metric names provide explanatory tooltips with links to documentation (Wikipedia for standard metrics, Stickler docs for ECARB@30). Available for all accuracy metrics, confidence metrics, confusion matrix components, error rates, and split classification metrics

**How It Works:**
- Backend stores confusion matrix values (TP, FP, TN, FN) from Stickler aggregation
- Backend computes confidence calibration metrics (AUROC, ECE, Brier) using Stickler v0.4.0+ ConfidenceCalculator
- UI calculates Accuracy, Precision, and Recall on-the-fly from confusion matrix values
- Confidence columns dynamically appear only when `confidenceMetrics` data is present
- Metrics displayed with 3 decimal precision (e.g., 0.850)

**Use Cases:**
- **Extraction Quality**: Identify which fields have low extraction accuracy
- **Confidence Calibration**: Discover poorly calibrated confidence predictions (high ECE = overconfident or underconfident)
- **Confidence Discrimination**: Check if confidence separates correct from incorrect predictions (low AUROC = poor discrimination)
- **Comparison**: Compare field-level performance across test runs
- **Prioritization**: Prioritize prompt engineering efforts on problematic fields or fields with poor confidence calibration
- **Tracking**: Track improvement in specific fields after configuration changes

#### Confidence Calibration Metrics (Stickler v0.4.0+)

The evaluation engine uses **Stickler v0.4.0** to compute confidence calibration metrics alongside traditional accuracy metrics. These metrics assess how well the model's confidence scores reflect actual correctness.

**What Are Confidence Calibration Metrics?**

When a model extracts a field with 90% confidence, ideally 90% of such predictions should be correct. Calibration metrics measure how closely confidence aligns with accuracy:

| Metric | What It Measures | Perfect Score | Interpretation |
|--------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **AUROC** | Discrimination: Can confidence separate correct from incorrect predictions? | 1.0 | 0.5 = random guessing, 1.0 = perfect discrimination |
| **ECE** | Calibration: How far off is confidence from actual accuracy? | 0.0 | 0.0 = perfectly calibrated, >0.1 = poorly calibrated |
| **Brier** | Overall quality: Mean squared error between confidence and correctness | 0.0 | 0.0 = perfect, 0.25 = random guessing, 1.0 = worst |
| **ECARB@30** | **The business metric**: Errors caught when reviewing 30% of data (sorted by confidence) | 100% (high gain) | Shows practical value - e.g., "89% (3.0x)" = reviewing lowest-confidence 30% catches 89% of errors, 3x better than random sampling |

**Example Scenarios:**

- **Good AUROC (0.95), Low ECE (0.03)**: Model confidences are well-calibrated and discriminate errors effectively
- **Good AUROC (0.92), High ECE (0.18)**: Model can distinguish errors but is systematically overconfident or underconfident
- **Poor AUROC (0.62), Any ECE**: Confidence scores don't correlate with correctness — unreliable even if calibrated
- **ECARB@30 = 89% (3.0x)**: **The business metric** - If you can only manually review 30% of extracted data, sorting by confidence (lowest first) lets you catch 89% of errors with 3x better efficiency than random sampling. This answers the practical question: "How much value does confidence-guided review provide?"

**How Calibration Metrics Are Computed:**

1. **Document Evaluation**: For each document, the evaluation service:
   - Flattens confidence scores from extraction results (unwraps wrapper keys like `Item_N`, `Record_N`)
   - Patches Stickler's comparison results with `field_path` for matching
   - Stores `stickler_comparison_result` with confidences in `results.json`

2. **Test Aggregation**: When viewing test results, the aggregation function:
   - Loads all `stickler_comparison_result` records for the test run
   - Computes calibration metrics (AUROC, ECE, Brier) using Stickler's `ConfidenceMetricsCalculator`
   - Computes ECAB (Error Capture at Budget) metrics using `BulkStructuredModelEvaluator` with `ErrorCaptureAtBudgetMetric`
   - Aggregates path-based keys (e.g., `LineItems[0].Rate`) to pattern-based keys (`LineItems.Rate`)
   - Merges ECAB metrics into the confidence metrics structure
   - Returns `confidence_metrics` field with overall and per-field calibration data

3. **UI Display**: The test results table:
   - Displays AUROC, ECE, Brier, and ECARB@30 columns alongside accuracy metrics
   - ECARB@30 shows as "XX% (Y.Yx)" format (e.g., "89% (3.0x)")
   - Shows metrics for both leaf fields (e.g., `LineItems.Rate`) and parent fields (e.g., `LineItems`)
   - Dynamically hides columns when no confidence data is available
   - Shows "N/A" for fields lacking confidence data

**Known Limitations:**

- **Overall Brier Score**: Stickler v0.4.0's bulk aggregator returns `null` for overall Brier score (implementation pending). However, **field-level Brier scores are computed** via scikit-learn in the test aggregation function and are available in the field metrics table.
- **Coverage**: Confidence metrics only available for fields where extraction service provided confidence scores
- **Backward Compatibility**: Test runs executed before Stickler v0.4.0 upgrade will not have confidence calibration data

**Architecture:**

- **Evaluation Service**: `lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/evaluation/service.py`
  - Flattens confidence scores and patches field_comparisons
- **Confidence Integration**: `lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/evaluation/confidence_integration.py`
  - Wrapper for Stickler's ConfidenceMetricsCalculator
- **Test Aggregation**: `patterns/unified/src/test_execution_aggregation_function/index.py`
  - Computes and aggregates calibration metrics across test run
- **UI Display**: `src/ui/src/components/test-studio/TestResults.tsx`
  - Renders confidence columns in field metrics table
