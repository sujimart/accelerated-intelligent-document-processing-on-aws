# SRT — SAST & Dependency Scan

Static analysis (Bandit, Semgrep, Checkov), dependency inventory (Syft), and the security-matrix review, aggregated by the [Sample Security Review Tool](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-security-review-tool). The gate is **open HIGH** findings only; lower tiers are reported as counts (they are dominated by tracked third-party/vendored code).

## Summary

- **Gate (open HIGH findings):** PASS ✅
- **CI-visible findings:** 8513
- **Source:** live scan results (`.srt/issues.json`) — 88 git-ignored finding(s) excluded to match the CI view

## Analyzers executed

## Suppressed HIGH findings (accepted risk / scanner limitation)

Each carries a recorded justification; the authoritative register is `scripts/srt/issues.json`.

| Source | Check | Path | Justification |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|
| security-matrix | `KMS-007` | `notebooks/examples/demo-lambda/template.yml` | Accepted: KMS key event monitoring (CloudTrail/EventBridge/alarms) is account-level infrastructure owned by the deploying customer, out of scope for the solution template. |
| security-matrix | `DDB-002` | `patterns/unified/template.yaml` | Accepted: CloudTrail DynamoDB data-plane logging is an account-level control (trail + log bucket) owned by the deploying customer; the solution template cannot assume or create account-wide trails. |
| security-matrix | `EC2-002` | `scripts/sdlc/cfn/sdlc-iam-role.yml` | Accepted: BuilderRole is SDLC pipeline scaffolding for dev accounts and intentionally broad to build/publish all solution artifacts. |
| security-matrix | `S3-001` | `scripts/sdlc/cfn/s3-sourcecode.yml` | Accepted: SDLC bootstrap scaffolding deployed in dev accounts; access logging omitted for short-lived pipeline source bucket. |
| security-matrix | `S3-008` | `scripts/sdlc/cfn/s3-sourcecode.yml` | Accepted: SDLC pipeline scaffolding bucket in solution-builder dev accounts; retention of pipeline source/artifact objects is the pipeline owner's decision, and a lifecycle policy here is cost optimization rather than a security control. |
| security-matrix | `KMS-007` | `scripts/sdlc/cfn/codepipeline-s3.yml` | Accepted: KMS key event monitoring (CloudTrail/EventBridge/alarms) is account-level infrastructure owned by the deploying customer, out of scope for the solution template. |
| security-matrix | `IAM-009` | `scripts/sdlc/cfn/codepipeline-s3.yml` | Accepted: CodeBuild role in SDLC dev-account scaffolding; a permissions boundary is the account owner's policy decision, the template cannot assume one exists. |
| security-matrix | `S3-001` | `scripts/sdlc/cfn/codepipeline-s3.yml` | Accepted: SDLC pipeline artifact bucket in dev accounts; access logging omitted for pipeline scaffolding. |
| security-matrix | `S3-008` | `scripts/sdlc/cfn/codepipeline-s3.yml` | Accepted: SDLC pipeline scaffolding bucket in solution-builder dev accounts; retention of pipeline source/artifact objects is the pipeline owner's decision, and a lifecycle policy here is cost optimization rather than a security control. |
| security-matrix | `KMS-007` | `template.yaml` | Accepted: KMS key event monitoring (CloudTrail/EventBridge/alarms) is account-level infrastructure owned by the deploying customer, out of scope for the solution template. |
| security-matrix | `S3-008` | `template.yaml` | Accepted: bucket retention is a customer data-governance decision (evaluation baselines, working documents); imposing a lifecycle policy in the template risks deleting customer data. |
| security-matrix | `S3-005` | `template.yaml` | False positive at scan time: WebUIBucket is fronted by CloudFront with an OriginAccessControl (sigv4, SigningBehavior always) plus a bucket policy conditioned on the distribution ARN when CloudFront hosting is enabled; the conditional resources cannot be evaluated statically. |
| security-matrix | `S3-008` | `template.yaml` | Accepted: WebUIBucket holds only the current built web-app bundle, redeployed in full by CodeBuild on each update; there is no object accumulation to manage, and an expiry lifecycle rule could delete live UI assets. |
| security-matrix | `DDB-002` | `template.yaml` | Accepted: CloudTrail DynamoDB data-plane logging is an account-level control (trail + log bucket) owned by the deploying customer; the solution template cannot assume or create account-wide trails. |
| security-matrix | `DDB-002` | `template.yaml` | Accepted: CloudTrail DynamoDB data-plane logging is an account-level control (trail + log bucket) owned by the deploying customer; the solution template cannot assume or create account-wide trails. |

| security-matrix | `DDB-002` | `template.yaml` | Accepted: CloudTrail DynamoDB data-plane logging is an account-level control (trail + log bucket) owned by the deploying customer; the solution template cannot assume or create account-wide trails. |
| security-matrix | `LAMBDA-004` | `nested/bedrockkb/template.yaml` | Accepted: X-Ray tracing intentionally omitted on helper/custom-resource Lambdas; enabling tracing is a customer deployment choice for this sample solution. |
| security-matrix | `LAMBDA-011` | `nested/bedrockkb/template.yaml` | Accepted: CloudWatch alarms for helper/custom-resource Lambdas are intentionally omitted; failures surface via CloudFormation stack status. Alarm topology is a customer operations decision. |
| security-matrix | `KMS-007` | `template.yaml` | Accepted: KMS key event monitoring (CloudTrail/EventBridge/alarms) is account-level infrastructure owned by the deploying customer, out of scope for the solution template. |
| security-matrix | `EC2-002` | `template.yaml` | False positive: BastionRole (Condition ShouldDeployBastionHost, off by default) carries exactly the managed policy the finding's own fix recommends - AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore - and nothing else; the instance profile attaches only that role. No excess privilege exists. |
| security-matrix | `EC2-002` | `template.yaml` | False positive: BastionRole (Condition ShouldDeployBastionHost, off by default) carries exactly the managed policy the finding's own fix recommends - AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore - and nothing else; the instance profile attaches only that role. No excess privilege exists. |
| security-matrix | `DDB-002` | `feature-platform/main-stack-extensions/template.yaml` | Accepted: CloudTrail DynamoDB data-plane logging is an account-level control (trail + log bucket) owned by the deploying customer; the solution template cannot assume or create account-wide trails. |
| security-matrix | `DDB-002` | `feature-platform/sample-health-insurance-review/template.yaml` | Accepted: CloudTrail DynamoDB data-plane logging is an account-level control (trail + log bucket) owned by the deploying customer; the solution template cannot assume or create account-wide trails. |
| security-matrix | `DDB-002` | `template.yaml` | Accepted: CloudTrail DynamoDB data-plane logging is an account-level control (trail + log bucket) owned by the deploying customer; the solution template cannot assume or create account-wide trails. |
| security-matrix | `DDB-002` | `nested/api-resolvers/template.yaml` | Accepted: CloudTrail DynamoDB data-plane logging is an account-level control (trail + log bucket) owned by the deploying customer; the solution template cannot assume or create account-wide trails. |
| security-matrix | `API-GW-002` | `nested/api-resolvers/template.yaml` | Accepted: REST API in Lambda-proxy mode; the data-plane POST method is Cognito-authorized and the dispatcher Lambda validates each request body per-field, and the remaining method is the auth-less MOCK OPTIONS CORS preflight (static 200, no backend). API GW request validators add no value for opaque proxy payloads. |
| security-matrix | `API-GW-004` | `nested/api-resolvers/template.yaml` | Accepted: intentional public static-asset route (enabled only when ServeWebUI=true). This GET serves the React SPA shell (index.html) from S3 to the browser BEFORE the user authenticates in-app; auth happens later against the Cognito-authorized /op POST. A JWT cannot be attached to the browser's initial document fetch, so AuthorizationType NONE is required, and only non-sensitive static UI files are exposed. Defense-in-depth: the stage-level WAFv2 IP allowlist (IsWafEnabled) and the PRIVATE-endpoint VPC policy (UsePrivateApi) still gate this route. |
| security-matrix | `API-GW-004` | `nested/api-resolvers/template.yaml` | Accepted: intentional public static-asset route (enabled only when ServeWebUI=true). This GET /{proxy+} serves hashed SPA static assets (js/css/fonts/images) from S3 to the browser BEFORE the user authenticates in-app; auth happens later against the Cognito-authorized /op POST. A JWT cannot be attached to the browser's asset fetches, so AuthorizationType NONE is required, and only non-sensitive static UI files are exposed. Defense-in-depth: the stage-level WAFv2 IP allowlist (IsWafEnabled) and the PRIVATE-endpoint VPC policy (UsePrivateApi) still gate this route. |
| security-matrix | `API-GW-001` | `nested/api-resolvers/template.yaml` | Accepted (scanner limitation): the stage DOES configure AccessLogSetting with both a DestinationArn (HttpApiAccessLogGroup, KMS-encrypted, RetentionInDays=LogRetentionDays) and a JSON Format, but they are wrapped in Fn::If [EnableApiAccessLogs] (on at LogLevel INFO/DEBUG). SRT's security-matrix cannot resolve Fn::If, so it does not see the DestinationArn/Format inside the conditional branch. Access logging is correctly implemented; the conditionality is intentional to avoid log costs at higher LogLevels. |
| security-matrix | `API-GW-006` | `nested/api-resolvers/template.yaml` | Accepted (scanner limitation): the stage DOES set MethodSettings with LoggingLevel ERROR for ResourcePath '/*' HttpMethod '*', but wrapped in Fn::If [EnableApiAccessLogs]. SRT cannot resolve Fn::If and reads MethodSettings as a non-array, so it reports execution logging disabled. Execution logging is deliberately ERROR-only (INFO would echo full request/response payloads, incl. customer document data, into CloudWatch); JSON access logs cover request metadata. Logging is correctly implemented; the conditionality is intentional. |
| security-matrix | `DDB-002` | `feature-platform/idp-data-generator/template.yaml` | Accepted: CloudTrail DynamoDB data-plane logging is an account-level control (trail + log bucket) owned by the deploying customer; the solution template cannot assume or create account-wide trails. Consistent with all other DynamoDB tables in this solution. |
| security-matrix | `LAMBDA-005` | `feature-platform/idp-data-generator/template.yaml` | Accepted: bedrock-agentcore:* on Resource '*' is required — CreateAgentRuntime transitively creates/deletes runtime endpoints and other sub-resources, so an action allow-list breaks create/delete; these control-plane APIs do not support resource-level permissions and the runtime ARN does not exist at create time. iam:PassRole/CreateServiceLinkedRole and logs are scoped. |
