# ZAP DAST — Dynamic API Scan

OWASP ZAP baseline/active scan of the deployed UI API (`POST /op/{field}`), seeded from a generated OpenAPI spec of every operation. Rules muted in `scripts/sdlc/zap-rules.conf` are excluded from the alert counts.

## Summary

- **Gate (High alerts):** PASS ✅
- **Alerts:** High=0 Medium=1 Low=0 Info=0
- **Rules exercised:** 118 (116 PASS · 1 WARN · 0 FAIL · 1 IGNORE)
- **URLs scanned:** 100

## Alerts (findings, most severe first)

| Risk | Alert | Instances | Remediation |
|------|-------|----------:|-------------|
| Medium | Cross-Domain Misconfiguration | 5 | Ensure that sensitive data is not available in an unauthenticated manner (using IP address white-listing, for instance). Configure the "Access-Control-Allow-Ori |

## Rules exercised (full outcome list)

Every ZAP rule run against the seeded API, with its outcome. `WARN`/`FAIL` are actionable; `IGNORE` is muted in `scripts/sdlc/zap-rules.conf`; `PASS` means the rule ran and found nothing.
