## Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive threat model for the GenAI IDP Accelerator — a serverless intelligent document processing solution on AWS. The threat model covers the unified architecture, all processing modes, features, extensibility points, and integrations.

### Key Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Threats identified | **83** |
| Critical risk (8–9) | 6 |
| High risk (6–7) | 26 |
| Medium risk (3–5) | 37 |
| Low risk (1–2) | 14 |
| Mitigated | 56 (67%) |
| Partially mitigated | 19 (23%) |
| Open (real gap, needs work) | **5 (6%)** |
| Accepted risk | 3 (4%) |

> **Counts are generated, not hand-maintained.** `deliverables/threat-model.tc.json`
> and the tallies above are produced by
> [`scripts/build_threat_model.py`](scripts/build_threat_model.py), which parses
> the Markdown corpus and joins it with a single curated status table. Run
> `python3 security/threat-modeling/scripts/build_threat_model.py` after adding
> or editing a threat; `--check` fails if the export has drifted. (Before v3.0
> these numbers disagreed across four documents and the JSON export was 25
> threats behind the corpus.)

### Open items requiring action

The five **Open** threats are gaps with no effective control today:

| ID | Threat | Where |
|----|--------|-------|
| CHAT.T03 | Chat streaming Function URL enforces neither RBAC group nor session ownership | [companion-chat.md](feature-threats/companion-chat.md) |
| CHAT.T06 | `/chat/agent` trusts a client-supplied `callerSub` over the SigV4 identity | [companion-chat.md](feature-threats/companion-chat.md) |
| UI.T06 | Presigned read URLs are bucket-scoped, not key-scoped; callable by any authenticated user | [web-ui.md](feature-threats/web-ui.md) |
| UI.T07 | No CSP emitted in `WebUIHosting=APIGateway` (incl. GovCloud) deployments | [web-ui.md](feature-threats/web-ui.md) |
| JOB.T02 | Jobs API is outside the automated authorization test harness | [jobs-api.md](feature-threats/jobs-api.md) |

| # | ID | Threat | Risk | Status |
|---|-----|--------|------|--------|
| 1 | PM.T01 | Prompt injection via document content | 9 | Mitigated |
| 2 | CHAT.T01 | Prompt injection via chat messages | 9 | Mitigated |

| 5 | HOOK.T02 | Data exfiltration via post-processing hook | 8 | Partially Mitigated |
| 6 | FEAT.T01 | Feature UI bundle executes unsandboxed in host origin | 8 | Partially Mitigated |
| 7 | CHAT.T03 | Chat streaming Function URL — no group / ownership check | 6 | **Open** |
| 8 | UI.T06 | Presigned read URLs bucket-scoped, not key-scoped | 6 | **Open** |

## Maintaining This Threat Model

1. **Add or edit the threat in its feature/architecture Markdown document** — the
   `### <ID>: <Title>` heading followed by the attribute table is the parsed unit.
2. **Add the ID to [`threat-id-glossary.md`](threat-id-glossary.md)** and to the
   `STATUS` table in [`scripts/build_threat_model.py`](scripts/build_threat_model.py)
   (risk score + mitigation status).
3. **Regenerate the export**: `python3 security/threat-modeling/scripts/build_threat_model.py`.
   It fails loudly on a duplicate ID or on drift between the corpus and `STATUS`.
4. **Update this README's counts** from the script's output.

Consider wiring `build_threat_model.py --check` into CI so the export cannot
silently fall behind the corpus again.

## Version History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 3.0 | 2026-07-28 | **AppSec review for v0.6.x.** Corrected controls credited to deleted machinery: UI.T03 (AppSync GraphQL query-depth/introspection limits → REST dispatcher reality), CHAT.T03 (AppSync subscription filters → Lambda Function URL, with newly-identified missing group/ownership checks), UI.T01 CSP (documented `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval` and `https:` script-src as *not* an anti-XSS control). Removed A2I/SageMaker from the HITL flow and trust boundary TB4 (HITL is now a built-in UI portal); removed the AppSync API layer from `system-overview.md`; rewrote all five AppSync sequence diagrams in `data-flows.md`. Added 19 threats for previously-unmodeled surfaces: **FEAT.T01–T04** (Feature Platform / third-party UI bundles in the host origin), **JOB.T01–T03** (Jobs API M2M OAuth realm), **PII.T01–T05** (preprocessing hook + PII redaction), **HOOK.T06** (preprocessing hook power), **PM.T08** (OpenAI GPT-5.x via `bedrock-mantle`), **UI.T06** (presigned-read key scoping), **UI.T07** (CSP divergence by hosting mode), **CHAT.T06** (client-supplied caller identity), **RPT.T07** (ground-truth editor), **RPT.T08** (document version retention). Reconciled counts across all documents (62/64/58 → **83**) and made the JSON export **generated** rather than hand-maintained. 64 → 83 threats. |
| 2.1 | 2026-07-13 | RBAC doc updated to REST-dispatcher architecture (AppSync removed); added AUTH.T07 (config-version scope bypass / fail-open scope lookup) and AUTH.T08 (silently-ignored schema auth directives); documented the automated authorization test harness (`make api-test` / `make api-test-static`) as a control; 62 → 64 threats. **Note:** this update covered `rbac-authentication.md` and the glossary only — the remaining 18 documents were left at v2.0, which v3.0 corrects. |
| 2.0 | 2025-03-19 | Complete rework: unified architecture, removed Pattern 3/SageMaker, added 9 feature-specific threat analyses (agents, chat, MCP, KB, RBAC, SDK, hooks, UI, reporting), expanded from 31 to 62 threats |
| 1.0 | 2024-12-01 | Initial threat model with 3 separate patterns (BDA, Textract+Bedrock, Textract+SageMaker+Bedrock) |
