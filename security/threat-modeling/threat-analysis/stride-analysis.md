## 1. Overview

This document provides a comprehensive STRIDE analysis across all components of the GenAI IDP Accelerator unified architecture. Each STRIDE category is analyzed for the system's major components: document processing pipeline, AI/ML services, web UI, agent system, authentication/authorization, extensibility (hooks/MCP), and data storage/analytics.
