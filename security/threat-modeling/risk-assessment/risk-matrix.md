## 1. Risk Scoring Methodology

### Likelihood Scale

| Rating | Score | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1 | Requires specialized skills, insider access, or unlikely conditions |
| **Medium** | 2 | Feasible with moderate effort by authenticated users or sophisticated attackers |
| **High** | 3 | Readily exploitable with common tools or by any authenticated user |

### Severity Scale

| Rating | Score | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1 | Minimal impact, cosmetic or informational |
| **Medium** | 2 | Moderate impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability for limited scope |
| **High** | 3 | Significant impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability |
| **Critical** | 4 | Severe impact: complete data breach, system compromise, or total service loss |

### Risk Score

**Risk = Likelihood × Severity**

| Risk Score | Risk Level | Action Required |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1-2 | **Low** | Accept or monitor |
| 3-4 | **Medium** | Mitigate with standard controls |
| 6 | **High** | Prioritize mitigation |
| 8-9 | **Very High** | Immediate mitigation required |
| 12 | **Critical** | Block deployment until mitigated |

## 5. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions — Open gaps (no effective control today)

These are code/config changes, not documentation work, and are ordered by
effort-to-value:

1. **Chat streaming authorization (CHAT.T03 + CHAT.T06)** — enforce session
   ownership in both vendored streaming processors (reuse the existing
   `ownerSub`-vs-`caller_sub` comparison before loading memory) and enforce the
   Admin/Author/Viewer group on `/chat/agent`. **Fix CHAT.T06 first or together**:
   `/chat/agent` currently prefers a client-supplied `callerSub` over the SigV4
   identity, which would silently neuter an ownership check that reads it.
   Then extend the automated harness to cover this transport — today
   `make api-test` drives `POST /op/{field}` only, so a regression here is
   undetectable.
2. **Presigned read key scoping (UI.T06)** — derive the permitted key prefix
   from the caller's identity/scope instead of trusting the supplied `s3Uri`,
   and make the bucket allow-list fail **closed** when its env vars are unset.
   This is a prerequisite for `allowedConfigVersions` to be a real boundary, and
   it also bounds RPT.T08 and PII.T05.
3. **CSP in APIGateway hosting mode (UI.T07)** — add a static
   `Content-Security-Policy` header to `WebUIRootMethod`/`WebUIProxyMethod`,
   matching the other four security headers already set there. Cheap; closes a
   gap that lands specifically in GovCloud/private deployments.
4. **Jobs API scope-negative test (JOB.T02)** — add a `jobs.read`-only-token
   write attempt and an unauthenticated request to the Jobs API stack test, so
   the gate asymmetry with the UI API closes.

### Next Actions (Critical/High Risk, Partially Mitigated)

1. **Feature bundle integrity (FEAT.T01, FEAT.T04)**: record a SHA-384 digest of
   each `ui-bundle.js` at install time and set `script.integrity` in
   `FeatureLoader` — the single highest-value hardening for the Feature Platform,
   converting silent bundle substitution into a blocked load
2. **MCP Data Exfiltration (MCP.T01)**: Implement VPC egress controls for MCP Lambda functions; establish MCP agent security review process
3. **Post-Processing Hook Exfiltration (HOOK.T02)**: Document customer-side VPC and egress control requirements; provide reference architecture for secure hook deployment
4. **SDK Credential Management (SDK.T01, SDK.T02)**: Implement credential helper integration; provide secure automation pipeline templates
5. **Hook IAM Scoping (HOOK.T05, MCP.T04)**: Publish IAM role templates for hook Lambdas with least-privilege configurations
6. **XSS defense-in-depth (UI.T01)**: complete the Monaco editor compatibility
   work so `'unsafe-inline'`/`'unsafe-eval'` can be dropped from `script-src`,
   and narrow `script-src`'s `https:` to `'self'` (Talos #12 phase 2)
7. **Ground-truth change visibility (RPT.T07)**: surface/alert on baseline
   `_editHistory` mutations for high-value test sets

### Ongoing Monitoring

1. **Prompt Injection Detection**: Monitor evaluation metrics for accuracy degradation that may indicate ongoing prompt injection attacks
2. **Authorization Audit**: Periodic review of resolver-Lambda authorization checks for completeness — automated by `make api-test-static` (drift + missing-check scan) and `make api-test` (live op×role matrix)
3. **Athena Query Monitoring**: Alert on unusual query patterns or data volumes
4. **Agent Usage Monitoring**: Track agent tool invocation patterns for anomalies
