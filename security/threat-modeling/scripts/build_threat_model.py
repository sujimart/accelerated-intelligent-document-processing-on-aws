"""Build the machine-readable threat model export from the Markdown corpus.

The Markdown documents under ``security/threat-modeling/`` are the source of
truth for threat *content*. This script parses every ``| **Threat ID** |``
block out of them, joins it with the curated status/risk table below, and emits
``deliverables/threat-model.tc.json`` (Threat Composer shaped).

Why a script: the previous export drifted badly out of sync with the corpus
(58 threats in JSON vs 64 in Markdown, stopping at AUTH.T06), because it was
maintained by hand. Regenerate instead of editing the JSON:

    python3 security/threat-modeling/scripts/build_threat_model.py

``--check`` exits non-zero if the committed JSON differs from a fresh build, or
if the corpus and the STATUS table below have drifted apart — wire this into CI
to keep them locked together.
