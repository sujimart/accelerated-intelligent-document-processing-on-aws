## 1. Overview

Pipeline mode is the default processing mode. It uses Amazon Textract (or BDA-as-OCR) for OCR and Amazon Bedrock foundation models (Claude, Nova, or OpenAI GPT-5.x) for classification and extraction — with per-field confidence and geometry produced inside extraction — plus summarization. This mode provides maximum configurability with separate prompts and model selection for each processing stage.

### 2.1 Processing Steps

| Step | Lambda | AWS Service | Input | Output |
|------|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| **OCR** | OCR Lambda | Amazon Textract (`TABLES`+`LAYOUT` by default) **or** Bedrock Data Automation standard output | S3 document URI | Text, layout, tables, word-level confidence + geometry |
| **Classification** | Classification Lambda | Bedrock (Claude/Nova) or `bedrock-mantle` (GPT-5.x) | OCR text + class definitions | Document type + confidence |
| **Extraction** | Extraction Lambda | Bedrock (Claude/Nova) or `bedrock-mantle` (GPT-5.x) | OCR text + extraction schema | Structured JSON + **per-field confidence + bounding boxes** |
| **Assessment** *(conditional)* | Assessment Lambda | Bedrock (Claude/Nova) | Extracted data | Per-field confidence — **only** under `confidence.mode: separate` |

> **Sharded extraction.** Advanced (agentic) extraction shards large documents
> across a Step Functions **Distributed Map**; each shard persists idempotently
> to S3, and confidence assessment + geometry grounding run **inside** each
> shard before a merge step reconciles row counts. Shard/batch sizes are derived
> from the model's context/output window minus `extraction.context_buffer`.
> Relevant to PM.T04 (cross-step poisoning) since shard outputs are
> intermediate S3 state.

### 2.2 Configurable Elements

Each step is independently configurable via the YAML configuration:
- **Model selection**: Different models per step, including **cross-vendor** choices (Anthropic / Nova / OpenAI GPT-5.x) — see PM.T08
- **Custom prompts**: Full control over system and user prompts
- **Extraction schemas**: JSON Schema-based field definitions with types, descriptions, validation rules
- **Classification definitions**: Document type names, descriptions, few-shot examples
- **Confidence & geometry**: `confidence.mode` (`integrated`/`separate`/`off`), `geometry.mode` (`ocr_only` default, `llm`, `llm_grounded`), thresholds and per-field alerts
- **Few-shot examples**: S3-stored example documents for improved accuracy
- **Reasoning effort**: `reasoning_effort` for effort-capable models (extraction defaults to `low`)

### PM.T08: Document Content Sent to a Non-Anthropic Model Family (OpenAI via `bedrock-mantle`)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Threat ID** | PM.T08 |
| **Category** | STRIDE: Information Disclosure |
| **Description** | Since v0.6.1 the configured model for OCR, classification, extraction, assessment, summarization, evaluation, and Chat-with-Document may be an **OpenAI GPT-5.x** variant (`openai.gpt-5.6-sol` / `-terra` / `-luna`, plus GPT-5.4/5.5) served on the `bedrock-mantle` OpenAI Responses API. Full document text — including any PII the pipeline has not redacted — is then sent to a **different model family** than the Anthropic/Nova default that earlier versions of this threat model assumed. Deployments operating under a vendor-approval list, a model-provider restriction, or a data-residency policy may be out of compliance without any configuration change appearing security-relevant: selecting a model is an ordinary config edit made by an Admin/Author in the UI. |
| **Attack Vector** | Not primarily adversarial: an Author selects a GPT-5.x model from the config dropdown for cost or quality reasons, unaware of a vendor/residency constraint. Adversarially, a config-tampering attacker (PM.T06) could switch the model to change where document content egresses. |
| **Impact** | Document content and PII processed by a model family the deployment may not have approved; potential compliance/residency violation. Region exposure also changes: GPT-5.6 is **US-only** (Sol in `us-east-1`/`us-east-2`; Terra/Luna add `us-west-2`), with no EU/global profiles and **no GovCloud** — so selecting one in an EU-oriented deployment moves inference to US regions. |
| **Likelihood** | Medium (a normal config action) |
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Affected Components** | `idp_common/bedrock/openai_responses.py`, model config enums, config UI model dropdowns, pricing/limits tables |
| **Mitigations** | All traffic stays **within Amazon Bedrock in the customer's own account** — this is a Bedrock-served model, not a call out to OpenAI's own API, so it does not leave the AWS trust boundary (TB4) and is covered by the same TLS/IAM controls and no-training posture. Model selection requires the **Admin/Author** group and is config-versioned and audit-logged, so a change is attributable and reversible (PM.T06 controls apply). Bedrock model access must be explicitly requested/enabled per model in the account, giving a second account-level gate outside the application. Region availability is enforced by Bedrock itself — an unavailable model fails loudly rather than silently rerouting. GovCloud deployments **cannot** select GPT-5.6 at all. Agentic extraction, Discovery, and Policy Discovery reject these models at `config-validate` and at runtime. |
| **Residual risk / recommendation** | The application does not implement an allow-list restricting *which* Bedrock models a deployment may select — any model in the enum is choosable by an Author. Deployments with vendor constraints should (1) restrict model access at the **Bedrock account level** (the effective control), and (2) treat the model fields in a config version as security-relevant in change review. Consider a stack parameter constraining the selectable model set for regulated deployments. |
