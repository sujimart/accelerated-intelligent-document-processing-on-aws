"""Discover and run every Python test suite in the repo, one root at a time.

Why not a single ``pytest`` from the repo root? Several packages ship their own
``tests/conftest.py``; pytest imports them all as the module ``tests.conftest``
and aborts with ``ImportPathMismatchError`` / duplicate-plugin errors. Each
package/Lambda also has its own mini-environment (relative imports, per-dir
conftest, ``sys.modules`` shims). So each test *root* must run as a SEPARATE
pytest invocation.

The maintenance hazard with a hand-written list of roots (the old ``make test``)
is that a brand-new test directory is silently never run. This script removes
that hazard: it DISCOVERS every directory containing ``test_*.py`` and checks it
against two explicit registries — ``RUN_ROOTS`` (run in the gate) and
``QUARANTINE`` (known-excluded, each with a reason). A directory in NEITHER list
is a hard error, so adding tests in a new location forces a conscious decision
here.

Usage:
    python scripts/run_all_tests.py            # run the gate (unit-level suites)
    python scripts/run_all_tests.py --list     # print the plan, run nothing
    python scripts/run_all_tests.py --integration   # run only integration suites
