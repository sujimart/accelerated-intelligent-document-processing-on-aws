"""Pipeline-hooks dispatcher Lambda.

Invoked by the host's Step Functions workflow at each pipeline extension
point (preprocessing, postOcr, postClassification, postExtraction,
postRuleValidation, postSummarization). Reads the active configuration
version from the host's ConfigurationTable and dispatches to the hook
Lambdas listed under that section's hook-list field. The field is chosen
by the hook point prefix: `pre*` points read `preHook`, `post*` points
read `postHook`.

Hooks are stored *inline in the active config version* — under each
section — so that activating a different config version atomically swaps
the hook set:

    Config#<version>
      preprocessing:            # standalone section — runs FIRST, before the
        enabled: true           # BDA/pipeline routing. A SINGLE inline hook:
        arn: <lambda-arn>       # arn/args/onError live directly on the section
        onError: fail           # (no list), so it reads cleanly in the config UI.
        args: [ { key, value }, ... ]   # generic key/value config for the hook
      ocr:
        postHook:               # post-step points keep a LIST of hooks
          - { featureId, arn, order, onError, enabled, args }
      classification:
        postHook: [ ... ]
      extraction:
        postHook: [ ... ]
      rule_validation:
        postHook: [ ... ]
      summarization:
        postHook: [ ... ]

The dispatcher's return value includes a top-level `halt` flag (true if any
successful hook returned result.halt == true) so the workflow's post-hook
Choice can short-circuit the execution via a stable JSONPath.

It ALSO always includes a top-level `document` — the document the next
workflow step should consume. A hook that wants to change the document for
downstream steps returns `{"updatedDocument": <doc>}`; the dispatcher
validates it, threads it into the next hook at the same point, and returns it
here. Hooks that return anything else (the historical, read-only contract) get
their input document echoed back verbatim, so the pipeline is byte-identical
to the pre-mutation behavior. The state machine copies this value into the
canonical path the next step reads via a small `Apply<Point>HookDocument`
Pass state (see statemachine/workflow.asl.json).

Resolution rules:
  1. If the SFN input has `document.config_version`, use it.
  2. Else, scan the table for the row with IsActive=true.
  3. Else, fall back to `Config#default`.

Returns immediately when the requested step has no `postHook` entries,
keeping the no-vertical-pack overhead at one DDB GetItem.
